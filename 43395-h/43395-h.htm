<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>O you, in your far-away home in Provence,
I send these tales out of the
remote North you love so well, and so well
understand. The same blood is in our veins,
a deep current somewhere beneath the tide
that sustains us. We have meeting-places
that none knows of; we understand what few
can understand; and we share in common a
strange and inexplicable heritage. It is because
you, who are called Kathia of the Sunway,
are also Kathia nan Ciar, Kathia of the
Shadow, it is because you are what you are
that I inscribe this book to you. In it you
will find much that is familiar to you, though
you may never have read or heard anything
of the kind; for there is a reality, beneath
the unfamiliar accident, which may be recognised
in a moment as native to the secret
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>4]</a></span>
life that lives behind the brain and the wise
nerves with their dim ancestral knowledge.</p>

<p>The greater portion of this book deals with
the remote life of a remote past. &ldquo;The
Shadow-Seers,&rdquo; however, though of to-day,
may equally be of yesterday or to-morrow;
and as for &ldquo;The Last Supper&rdquo; or &ldquo;The
Fisher of Men,&rdquo; they are of no time or date,
for they are founded upon elemental facts
which are modified but not transformed by
the changing years.</p>

<p>It may be the last of its kind I shall write&mdash;at
any rate, for a time. I would like it
to be associated with you, to whom not only
the mystery but the pagan sentiment and the
old barbaric emotion are so near. With the
second sight of the imagination we can often
see more clearly in the perspectives of the
past than in the maze of the present; and
most clearly when we recognise that, below
the accidents of time and circumstance, the
present is but a reflection of that past to
which we belong&mdash;belong, as intimately and
inalienably, as to the hour wherein happily
content we swing to those anchors which we
do not see are linked to us by ropes of sand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>5]</a></span>
If I am eager to have my say on other
aspects of our Celtic life in the remoter West
Highlands and in the Isles: now with the
idyllic, now with the tragic, now with the
grotesque, the humorous, the pathetic, with
all the medley cast from the looms of Life&mdash;all
that</p>

<div class="cpoem22">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;... from the looms of Life are spun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Warp of shadow and woof of sun&mdash;&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and if, too, I long to express anew something
of that wonderful historic romance in which
we of our race and country are so rich, I am
not likely to forget those earlier dreams
which are no whit less realities&mdash;realities of
the present seen through an inverted glass&mdash;which
have been, and are, so full of inspiration
and of a strange and terrible beauty.</p>

<p>But one to whom life appeals by a myriad
avenues, all alluring and full of wonder and
mystery, cannot always abide where the heart
longs most to be. It is well to remember
that there are shadowy waters even in the
cities, and that the Fount of Youth is discoverable
in the dreariest towns as well as in
Hy Br&agrave;sil: a truth apt to be forgotten by
those of us who dwell with ever-wondering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
delight in that land of lost romance which
had its own day, as this epoch of a still
stranger, if a less obvious, romance has its
own passing hour.</p>

<p>The titular piece&mdash;with its strange name
that will not be unfamiliar to you who know
our ancient Celtic literature, or may bear
in mind the striking use made of it and
its vague cognate legend, by Ferguson, in
his Irish epic, <i>Congal</i>&mdash;gives the keynote
not only of this book but of what has for
hundreds of years, and to some extent still
is, the characteristic of the purely Celtic
mind in the Highlands and the Isles. This
characteristic is a strange complexity of
paganism and Christianity, or rather an apparent
complexity arising from the grafting
of Christianity upon paganism. Columba,
St. Patrick, St. Ronan, Kentigern, all these
militant Christian saints were merely transformed
pagans. Even in the famous dialogue
between St. Patrick and Ois&igrave;n, which
is the folk-telling of the passing of the old
before the new, the thrill of a pagan sympathy
on the part of the uncompromising saint
is unmistakable. To this day, there are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>7]</a></span>
Christian rites and superstitions which are
merely a gloss upon a surviving antique
paganism. I have known an old woman, in
no wise different from her neighbours, who
on the day of Beltane sacrificed a hen:
though for her propitiatory rite she had no
warrant save that of vague traditionary lore,
the lore of the <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">teinntean</i>, of the hearth-side&mdash;where,
in truth, are best to be heard the
last echoes of the dim mythologic faith of our
ancestors. What is the familiar &ldquo;<span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">clachan</span>,&rdquo;
now meaning a hamlet with a kirk, but an
echo of the Stones, the circles of the druids
or of a more ancient worship still, that perhaps
of the mysterious Anait, whose sole
record is a <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">clach</i> on a lonely moor, of which
from time immemorial the people have
spoken as the &ldquo;Teampull na&rsquo;n Anait&rdquo;? A
relative of mine saw, in South Uist, less than
twenty-five years ago, what may have been
the last sun-sacrifice in Scotland, when an
old Gael secretly and furtively slew a lamb
on the summit of a conical grassy knoll at
sunrise. Those who have the Gaelic have
their ears filled with rumours of a day that
is gone. When an evicted crofter laments,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span>
<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">O mo chreach, mo chreach!</i><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> or some poor
soul on a bed of pain cries, <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">O mo chradshlat</i>,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
he who knows the past recognises in the one
the mournful refrain of the time when the
sea-pirates or the hill-robbers pillaged and
devasted quiet homesteads, and, in the other,
not the moan of suffering only, but the cry
of torment from the victim racked on the
<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">cradhshlat</i>, a bitter ignominious torture used
by the ancient Gaels. When, in good fellowship,
one man says to another, <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Tha, a
laochain</i> (yes, my dear fellow), he recalls
Fionn and the chivalry of eld, for <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">laochan</i> is
merely a contraction for <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">laoch-Fhinn</span>, meaning
a companion in war, a hero, literally
Fionn&rsquo;s right-hand man in battle. To this
day, women, accompanying a marching regiment,
are sometimes heard to say in the
Gaelic, &ldquo;We are going with the dear souls
to the wars&rdquo;&mdash;literally an echo of the
Ossianic <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Siubhlaidh sinn le&rsquo;n anam do&rsquo;n
araich</i>, &ldquo;We shall accompany their souls to the
battle-field.&rdquo; A thousand instances could be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>9]</a></span>
adduced. The language is a herring-net,
through which the unchanging sea filtrates,
even though the net be clogged with the fish
of the hour. Nor is it the pagan atmosphere
only that survives: often we breathe the air
of that early day when the mind of man was
attuned to a beautiful piety that was wrought
into nature itself. Of the several words for
the dawn, there is a beautiful one, <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Uinneagachadh</i>.
We have it in the phrase <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">&rsquo;nuair
a bha an latha ag uinneagachadh</i>, &ldquo;when the
day began to dawn.&rdquo; Now this word is simply
an extension of <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Uinneag</i>, a window: and the
application of the image dates far back to
the days of St. Columba, when some devout
and poetic soul spoke of the <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">uinneagan
Neimh</i>, the windows of Heaven.</p>

<div class="footnote">

</div>

<p>Sometimes, among the innumerable &ldquo;legendary
moralities&rdquo; which exist fragmentarily in
the West Highlands and in the Isles, there is
a coherent narrative basis&mdash;as, for example,
in the Irish and Highland folk-lore about St.
Bride, or Bridget, &ldquo;Muime Chriosd.&rdquo; Sometimes
there is simply a phrase survived out of
antiquity. I doubt if any now living, either
in the Hebrides or in Ireland, has heard any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>10]</a></span>
legend of the &ldquo;Washer of the Ford.&rdquo; The
name survives, with its atmosphere of a
remote past, its dim ancestral memory of a
shadowy figure of awe haunting a shadowy
stream in a shadowy land. Samuel Ferguson,
in <i>Congal</i>, has done little more than limn an
obscure shadow of that shadow: yet it haunts
the imagination. In the passage of paganism,
these old myths were too deep-rooted in the
Celtic mind to vanish at the bidding of the
Cross: thus came about that strange grafting
of the symbolic imagery of the devout Culdee,
of the visionary Mariolater, upon the surviving
Druidic and prehistoric imagination. In
a word, the Washer of the Ford might well
have appeared, to a single generation, now as
a terrible and sombre pagan goddess of death,
now as a symbolic figure in the new faith,
foreshadowing spiritual salvation and the
mystery of resurrection.</p>

<p>If in a composition such as &ldquo;The Annir-Choille,&rdquo;
there is the expression of revolt&mdash;not
ancient only, nor of the hour, but eternal,
for the revolt is of the sovereign nature within
us whereon all else is an accidental superstructure&mdash;against
the Christian ethic of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span>
renunciation, with an echo of our deep primeval
longing for earth-kinship with every life in
nature: if here there is the breath of a day
that may not come again, there is little or
nothing of the past, save what is merely accidental,
in &ldquo;The Fisher of Men&rdquo; or &ldquo;The
Last Supper.&rdquo; I like to think that these
<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">eachdaireachd Spioradail</i>, these spiritual
chronicles, might as well, in substance,
have been told a thousand years ago or be
written a thousand years hence. That Fisher
still haunts the invisible shadowy stream of
human tears: those mystic Spinners still ply
their triple shuttles, and the Fair Weaver of
Hope, now as of yore and for ever, sends his
rainbows adrift across the hearts and through
the minds of men. What does it matter,
again, that the Three Marvels of Hy are set
against the background of the Iona of St.
Columba? St. Francis blessed the birds of
Assisi, and San Antonio had a heart as tender
for all winged and gentle creatures: and
there are innumerable quiet gardens of peace
in the world even now where the kindred of
San Antonio and St. Francis and St. Columba
are kith to our fellow-beings, knowing them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>12]</a></span>
akin one and all to the seals whom St. Molios
blessed at the end of his days, and in his new
humbleness hailed as likewise of the company
of the Sons of God.</p>

<p>But of this I am sure. If there is spiritual
truth in the vision of the Blind Harper who
saw the Washer of the Ford, or in that of
Molios who hailed the seals as brethren, or
in that of Colum who blessed the birds and
the fish of the sea and even the vagrant
flies of the air, and saw the Moon-Child,
and in that seeing learned the last mystery
of the life of the soul, if in these, as in the
&ldquo;Fisher of Men&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Last Supper,&rdquo;
I have given faint utterance to the heart-knowledge
we all have, I would not have
you or any think that the pagan way is therefore
to me as the way of darkness. The
lost monk who loved the Annir-Choille was
doubtless not the less able to see the
Uinneagan Neimh because he was under
ban of Colum and all his kin: and there
are those of us who would rather be with
Cathal of the Woods, and be drunken with
green fire, than gain the paradise of the
holy Molios who banned him, if in that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>13]</a></span>
gain were involved the forfeiture of the
sunny green world, the joy of life, and the
earth-sweet ancient song of the blood that
is in the veins of youth.</p>

<p>These tales, let me add, are not legendary
&ldquo;mysteries&rdquo; but legendary &ldquo;moralities.&rdquo;
They are reflections from the mirror that is
often obscured but is never dimmed. There
is no mystery in them, or anywhere: except
the eternal mystery of beauty.</p>

<p>Of the Seanachas, the short barbaric tales,
I will say nothing to you, whose favourite
echo from Shelley is that thrilling line &ldquo;the
tempestuous loveliness of terror.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You in your far Provence, amid the austere
hills that guard an ancient land of olive and
vine, a land illumined by the blue flowing
light of the Rhone, and girt by desert places
where sun and wind inhabit, and scarce any
other&mdash;you there and I here have this in
common. Everywhere we see the life of
man in subservient union with the life of
Nature; never, in a word, as a sun beset by
tributary stars, but as one planet among the
innumerous concourse of the sky, nurtured,
it may be, by light from other luminaries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
and other spheres than we know of. That
we are intimately at one with Nature is a
cosmic truth we are all slowly approaching.
It is not only the dog, it is not only the wild
beast and the wood-dove, that are our close
kindred, but the green tree and the green
grass, the blue wave and the flowing wind,
the flower of a day and the granite peak of
an &aelig;on. And I for one would rather have
the wind for comrade, and the white stars
and green leaves as my kith and kin, than
many a human companion, whose chief claim
is the red blood that differs little from the
sap in the grass or in the pines, and whose
&ldquo;deathless soul&rdquo; is, mayhap, no more than a
fugitive light blown idly for an hour betwixt
dawn and dark. We are woven in one loom,
and the Weaver thrids our being with the
sweet influences, not only of the Pleiades,
but of the living world of which each is
no more than a multi-coloured thread: as,
in turn, He thrids the wandering wind
with the inarticulate cry, the yearning, the
passion, the pain, of that bitter clan, the
Human.</p>

<p>Truly, we are all one. It is a common
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>15]</a></span>
tongue we speak, though the wave has its
own whisper, and the wind its own sigh, and
the lip of the man its word, and the heart of
woman its silence.</p>

<p>Long, long ago a desert king, old and
blind, but dowered with ancestral wisdom beyond
all men that have lived, heard that the
Son of God was born among men. He rose
from his place, and on the eve of the third
day he came to where Jesus sat among the
gifts brought by the wise men of the East.
The little lad sat in Mary&rsquo;s lap, beneath a
tree filled with quiet light; and while the
folk of Bethlehem came and went He was
only a child as other children are. But
when the desert king drew near, the child&rsquo;s
eyes deepened with knowledge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, my little son?&rdquo; said Mary
the Virgin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, Mother dear,&rdquo; said Jesus, who had
never yet spoken a word, &ldquo;it is Deep Knowledge
that is coming to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what will that be, O my Wonder
and Glory?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That which will come in at the door before
you speak to me again.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>16]</a></span>
Even as the child spoke, an old blind
man entered, and bowed his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come near, O tired old man,&rdquo; said Mary
that had borne a son to Joseph, but whose
womb knew him not.</p>

<p>With that the tears fell into the old man&rsquo;s
beard. &ldquo;Sorrow of Sorrows,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but
that will be the voice of the Queen of
Heaven!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Jesus said to his mother: &ldquo;Take up
the tears, and throw them into the dark
night.&rdquo; And Mary did so: and lo! upon
the wilderness, where no light was, and on
the dark wave, where seamen toiled without
hope, clusters of shining stars rayed downward
in a white peace.</p>

<p>Thereupon the old king of the desert said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heal me, O King of the Elements.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Jesus healed him. His sight was
upon him again, and his gray ancientness
was green youth once more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have come with Deep Knowledge,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, sure, I am for knowing that,&rdquo; said
the King of the Elements, that was a little
child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>17]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well, if you will be knowing that, you
can tell me who is at my right side?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is my elder brother the Wind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what colour will the Wind be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now blue as Hope, now green as Compassion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who is on my left?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Shadow of Life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what colour will the Shadow be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That which is woven out of the bowels
of the earth and out of the belly of the
sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Truly, thou art the King of the Elements.
I am bringing you a great gift, I
am: I have come with Deep Knowledge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with that the old blind man, whose
eyes were now as stars, and whose youth
was a green garland about him, chanted nine
runes.</p>

<p>The first rune was the Rune of the Four
Winds.</p>

<p>The second rune was the Rune of the
Deep Seas.</p>

<p>The third rune was the Rune of the Lochs
and Rivers and the Rains and the Dews and
the many waters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>18]</a></span>
The fourth rune was the Rune of the
Green Trees and of all things that grow.</p>

<p>The fifth rune was the Rune of Man and
Bird and Beast, and of everything that lives
and moves, in the air, on the earth, and in
the sea: all that is seen of man, and all that
is unseen of man.</p>

<p>The sixth rune was the Rune of Birth,
from the spawn on the wave to the Passion
of Woman.</p>

<p>The seventh rune was the Rune of Death,
from the quenching of a gnat to the fading
of the stars.</p>

<p>The eighth rune was the Rune of the Soul
that dieth not, and the Spirit that is.</p>

<p>The ninth rune was the Rune of the Mud
and the Dross and the Slime of Evil&mdash;that
is the Garden of God, wherein He walks
with sunlight streaming from the palms of
his hands and with stars springing beneath
his feet.</p>

<p>Then when he had done, the old man
said: &ldquo;I have brought you Deep Knowledge.&rdquo;
But at that Jesus the Child said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;All this I heard on my way hither.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old desert king bowed his head.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>19]</a></span>
Then he took a blade of grass, and played
upon it. It was a wild, strange air that he
played.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Iosa mac Dhe, tell the woman what song
<em>that</em> is,&rdquo; cried the desert king.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the secret speech of the Wind that
is my Brother,&rdquo; cried the child, clapping his
hands for joy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what will this be?&rdquo; and with that
the old man took a green leaf, and played a
lovely whispering song.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the secret speech of the leaves,&rdquo;
cried Jesus the little lad, laughing low.</p>

<p>And thereafter the desert king played
upon a handful of dust, and upon a drop of
water, and upon a flame of fire; and the
Child laughed for the knowing and the joy.
Then he gave the secret speech of the singing
bird, and the barking fox, and the howling
wolf, and the bleating sheep: of all and
every created kind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O King of the Elements,&rdquo; he said then,
&ldquo;for sure you knew much; but now I have
made you to know the secret things of the
green Earth that is Mother of you and of
Mary too.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>20]</a></span>
But while Jesus pondered that one mystery,
the old man was gone: and when he
got to his people, they put him alive into a
hollow of the earth and covered him up,
because of his shining eyes, and the green
youth that was about him as a garland.</p>

<p>And when Christ was nailed upon the
Cross, Deep Knowledge went back into the
green world, and passed into the grass and
the sap in trees, and the flowing wind, and
the dust that swirls and is gone.</p>



<p class="break">All this is of the wisdom of the long ago,
and you and I are of those who know how
ancient it is, how remoter far than when
Mary, at the bidding of her little son, threw
up into the firmament the tears of an old
man.</p>

<p>It is old, old&mdash;</p>

<p>Is it wholly unwise, wholly the fantasy of a
dreamer, to insist, in this late day, when the
dust behind and the mist before hide from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>21]</a></span>
us the Beauty of the World, that we can

<h2>THE WASHER OF THE FORD</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN Torcall the Harper heard of the
death of his friend, Aodh-of-the-Songs,
he made a vow to mourn for him for
three seasons&mdash;a green time, an apple time,
and a snow time.</p>

<p>There was sorrow upon him because of
that death. True, Aodh was not of his kindred,
but the singer had saved the harper&rsquo;s
life when his friend was fallen in the Field of
Spears.</p>

<p>Torcall was of the people of the north&mdash;of
the men of Lochlin. His song was of the
fjords, and of strange gods, of the sword
and the war-galley, of the red blood and the
white breast, of Odin and Thor and Freya,
of Balder and the Dream-God that sits in the
rainbow, of the starry North, of the flames of
pale blue and flushing rose that play around
the Pole, of sudden death in battle, and of
Valhalla.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span>
Aodh was of the south isles, where these
shake under the thunder of the western seas.
His clan was of the isle that is now called
Barra, and was then Iond&ucirc;; but his mother
was a woman out of a royal rath in Banba,
as men of old called Eir&eacute;. She was so fair
that a man died of his desire of her. He
was named Ulad, and was a prince. &ldquo;The
Melancholy of Ulad&rdquo; was long sung in his
land after his end in the dark swamp, where
he heard a singing, and went laughing glad
to his death. Another man was made a
prince because of her. This was Aodh the
Harper, out of the Hebrid Isles. He won
the heart out of her, and it was his from the
day she heard his music and felt his eyes
flame upon her. Before the child was born,
she said, &ldquo;He shall be the son of love. He
shall be called Aodh. He shall be called
Aodh-of-the-Songs.&rdquo; And so it was.</p>

<p>Sweet were his songs. He loved, and he
sang, and he died.</p>

<p>And when Torcall that was his friend knew
this sorrow, he arose and made his vow, and
went out for evermore from the place where
he was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>27]</a></span>
Since the hour of the Field of Spears he
had been blind. Torcall Dall he was upon
men&rsquo;s lips thereafter. His harp had a moonshine
wind upon it from that day, it was said:
a beautiful strange harping when he went
down through the glen, or out upon the
sandy machar by the shore, and played what
the wind sang, and the grass whispered, and
the tree murmured, and the sea muttered or
cried hollowly in the dark.</p>

<p>Because there was no sight to his eyes,
men said he saw and he heard. What was
it he heard and he saw that they saw not
and heard not? It was in the voice that
was in the strings of his harp, so the rumour
ran.</p>

<p>When he rose and went away from his
place, the Maormor asked him if he went
north, as the blood sang; or south, as the
heart cried; or west, as the dead go; or
east, as the light comes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I go east,&rdquo; answered Torcall Dall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why so, Blind Harper?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For there is darkness always upon me,
and I go where the light comes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On that night of the nights, a fair wind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>28]</a></span>
blowing out of the west, Torcall the Harper
set forth in a galley. It splashed in the
moonshine as it was rowed swiftly by nine
men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sing us a song, O Torcall Dall!&rdquo; they
cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sing us a song, Torcall of Lochlin,&rdquo; said
the man who steered. He and all his company
were of the Gael: the Harper only was
of the Northmen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall I sing?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Shall
it be of war that you love, or of women that
twine you like silk o&rsquo; the kine; or shall it be
of death that is your meed; or of your dread,
the Spears of the North?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A low sullen growl went from beard to
beard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are under <i>geas</i>, Blind Harper,&rdquo; said
the steersman, with downcast eyes because of
his flaming wrath; &ldquo;we are under bond
to take you safe to the mainland, but we
have sworn no vow to sit still under the lash
of your tongue. &rsquo;Twas a wind-fleet arrow
that sliced the sight out of your eyes: have
a care lest a sudden sword-wind sweep the
breath out of your body.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>29]</a></span>
Torcall laughed a low, quiet laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it death I am fearing now&mdash;I who
have washed my hands in blood, and had
love, and known all that is given to man?
But I will sing you a song, I will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with that he took his harp, and struck
the strings.</p>

<span class="i0">A shadowy shape of cloud and mist, of gloom and dusk, she stands,<br /></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She counts the sins of all men there, and slays the red-stained horde&mdash;<br /></span>

</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She stoops and laughs when in the dust she sees a writhing limb:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Go back into the ford,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;and hither and thither swim;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>30]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then I shall wash you white as snow, and shall take you by the hand,<br /></span>

<span class="i5">This is the laughing word<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Of the Washer of the Ford<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Along that silent strand.<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There was silence for a time after Torcall
Dall sang that song. The oars took up the
moonshine and flung it hither and thither like
loose shining stones. The foam at the prow
curled and leaped.</p>

<p>Suddenly one of the rowers broke into a
long, low chant&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem26">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Yo, eily-a-ho, ayah-a-ho, eily-ayah-a-ho,</i><br /></span>

<span class="i2">Of the Washer of the Ford!<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And at that all ceased from rowing. Standing
erect, they lifted up their oars against the
stars, and the wild voices of them flew out
upon the night&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem26">
<div class="poem">

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>31]</a></span>
Torcall Dall laughed. Then he drew his
sword from his side and plunged it into the
sea. When he drew the blade out of the
water and whirled it on high, all the white
shining drops of it swirled about his head
like a sleety rain.</p>

<p>And at that the steersman let go the steering-oar
and drew his sword, and clove a flowing
wave. But with the might of his blow
the sword spun him round, and the sword
sliced away the ear of the man who had
the sternmost oar. Then there was blood in
the eyes of all there. The man staggered,
and felt for his knife, and it was in the heart
of the steersman.</p>

<p>Then because these two men were leaders,
and had had a blood-feud, and because all
there, save Torcall, were of one or the other
side, swords and knives sang a song.</p>

<p>The rowers dropped their oars; and four
men fought against three.</p>

<p>Torcall laughed, and lay back in his place.
While out of the wandering wave the death
of each man clambered into the hollow of
the boat, and breathed its chill upon its man,
Torcall the Blind took his harp. He sang
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>32]</a></span>
this song, with the swirling spray against his
face, and the smell of blood in his nostrils,
and the feet of him dabbling in the red tide
that rose there.</p>

<div class="cpoem30">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, &rsquo;tis a good thing the red blood, by Odin his word!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a good thing it is to hear it bubbling deep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when we hear the laughter of the Sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, the corbies croak, and the old wail, and the women weep!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And busy will she be there where she stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Washing the red out of the sins of all this slaying horde;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And trampling the bones of them into white powdery sands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And laughing low at the thirst of her thirsty sword&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i5">The Washer of the Ford!<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When he had sung that song there was
only one man whose pulse still beat, and he
was at the bow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A bitter black curse upon you, Torcall
Dall!&rdquo; he groaned out of the ooze of blood
that was in his mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who will you be?&rdquo; said the Blind
Harper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Fergus, the son of Art, the son of
Fergus of the D&ucirc;ns.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>33]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well, it is a song for your death I will
make, Fergus mac Art mhic Fheargus: and
because you are the last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that Torcall struck a wild sob out of
his harp, and he sang&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem30">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, death of Fergus, that is lying in the boat here,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Betwixt the man of the red hair and him of the black beard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rise now, and out of thy cold white eyes take out the fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And let Fergus mac Art mhic Fheargus see his weird!<br /></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sure, now, it&rsquo;s a blind man I am, but I&rsquo;m thinking I see<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The shadow of you crawling across the dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon you will twine your arm around his shaking knee,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And be whispering your silence into his listless head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that is why, O Fergus&mdash;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But here the man hurled his sword into
the sea, and with a choking cry fell forward;
and upon the white sands he was, beneath
the trampling feet of the Washer of the
Ford.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>34]</a></span></p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>It was a fair wind that blew beneath the
stars that night. At dawn the mountains of
Skye were like turrets of a great D&ucirc;n against
the east.</p>

<p>But Torcall the Blind Harper did not see
that thing. Sleep, too, was upon him. He
smiled in that sleep, for in his mind he saw
the dead men, that were of the alien people,
his foes, draw near the stream that was in a
far place. The shaking of them, poor,
tremulous frostbit leaves they were, thin and
sere, made the only breath there was in that
desert.</p>

<p>At the ford&mdash;this is what he saw in his
vision&mdash;they fell down like stricken deer
with the hounds upon them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is this stream?&rdquo; they cried in the
thin voice of rain across the moors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The River of Blood,&rdquo; said a voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who are you that are in the silence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am the Washer of the Ford.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with that each red soul was seized
and thrown into the water of the ford; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>35]</a></span>
when white as a sheep-bone on the hill, was
taken in one hand by the Washer of the
Ford and flung into the air, where no wind
was and where sound was dead, and was
then severed this way and that, in four
whirling blows of the sword from the four
quarters of the world. Then it was that the
Washer of the Ford trampled upon what fell
to the ground, till under the feet of her was
only a white sand, white as powder, light as
the dust of the yellow flowers that grow in
the grass.</p>

<p>It was at that Torcall Dall smiled in his
sleep. He did not hear the washing of the
sea; no, nor any idle plashing of the unoared
boat. Then he dreamed, and it was
of the woman he had left, seven summer-sailings
ago, in Lochlin. He thought her
hand was in his, and that her heart was
against his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, dear, beautiful heart of woman,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;and what is the pain that has put a
shadow upon you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a sweet voice that he heard coming
out of sleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Torcall, it is the weary love I have.&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;Ah, heart o&rsquo; me, dear! sure &rsquo;tis a bitter
pain I have had, too, and I away from you all
these years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a man&rsquo;s pain, and there&rsquo;s a
woman&rsquo;s pain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the blood of Balder, Hildyr, I would
have both upon me to take it off the dear
heart that is here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Torcall!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, white one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are not alone, we two in the dark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And when she had said that thing, Torcall
felt two baby arms go round his neck, and
two leaves of a wild rose press cool and sweet
against his lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! what is this?&rdquo; he cried, with his
heart beating, and the blood in his body
singing a glad song.</p>

<p>A low voice crooned in his ear: a bitter-sweet
song it was, passing-sweet, passing-bitter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, white one, white one,&rdquo; he moaned;
&ldquo;ah, the wee fawn o&rsquo; me! Baby o&rsquo; foam,
bonnie wee lass, put your sight upon me that
I may see the blue eyes that are mine too
and Hildyr&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>37]</a></span>
But the child only nestled closer. Like a
fledgling in a great nest she was. If God
heard her song, He was a glad God that
day. The blood that was in her body called
to the blood that was in his body. He could
say no word. The tears were in his blind
eyes.</p>

<p>Then Hildyr leaned into the dark, and
took his harp, and played upon it. It was
of the fonnsheen he had learned, far, far
away, where the isles are.</p>

<p>She sang: but he could not hear what she
sang.</p>

<p>Then the little lips, that were like a cool
wave upon the dry sand of his life, whispered
into a low song: and the wavering of it was
like this in his brain&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>With that, Torcall Dall gave a wild cry,
and sheathed an arm about the wee white
one, and put out a hand to the bosom that
loved him. But there was no white breast
there, and no white babe: and what was
against his lips was his own hand red with
blood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O Hildyr!&rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p>But only the splashing of the waves did he
hear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O white one!&rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p>But only the scream of a sea-mew, as it
hovered over that boat filled with dead men,
made answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>39]</a></span></p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>All day the Blind Harper steered the galley
of the dead. There was a faint wind
moving out of the west. The boat went
before it, slow, and with a low, sighing wash.</p>

<p>Torcall saw the red gaping wounds of the
dead, and the glassy eyes of the nine men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is better not to be blind and to see
the dead,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;than to be blind
and to see the dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man who had been steersman leaned
against him. He took him in his shuddering
grip and thrust him into the sea.</p>

<p>But when, an hour later, he put his hand
to the coolness of the water, he drew it back
with a cry, for it was on the cold, stiff face of
the dead man that it had fallen. The long
hair had caught in a cleft in the leather
where the withes had given.</p>

<p>For another hour Torcall sat with his chin
in his right hand, and his unseeing eyes staring
upon the dead. He heard no sound at
all, save the lap of wave upon wave, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>40]</a></span>
<i>suss</i> of spray against spray, and a bubbling
beneath the boat, and the low, steady swish
of the body that trailed alongside the steering
oar.</p>

<p>At the second hour before sundown he
lifted his head. The sound he heard was
the sound of waves beating upon rocks.</p>

<p>At the hour before sundown he moved the
oar rapidly to and fro, and cut away the body
that trailed behind the boat. The noise of
the waves upon the rocks was now a loud
song.</p>

<p>When the last sunfire burned upon his
neck and made the long hair upon his
shoulders ashine, he smelt the green smell
of grass. Then it was too that he heard the
muffled fall of the sea, in a quiet haven,
where shelves of sand were.</p>

<p>He followed that sound, and while he
strained to hear any voice the boat grided
upon the sand, and drifted to one side.
Taking his harp, Torcall drove an oar into
the sand, and leaped on to the shore. When
he was there, he listened. There was silence.
Far, far away he heard the falling of a
mountain-torrent, and the thin, faint cry of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>41]</a></span>
an eagle, where the sun-flame dyed its eyrie
as with streaming blood.</p>

<p>So he lifted his harp, and, harping low,
with a strange, wild song on his lips, moved
away from that place, and gave no more
thought to the dead.</p>

<p>It was deep gloaming when he came to a
wood. He felt the cold green breath of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said a voice, low and sweet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who will <em>you</em> be?&rdquo; asked Torcall
the Harper, trembling because of the sudden
voice in the stillness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a child, and here is my hand, and
I will lead you, Torcall of Lochlin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The blind man had fear upon him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you that in a strange place are
for knowing who I am?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, sure, it is coming I am, white one;
but tell me who you are, and whence you
came, and whither we go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then a voice that he knew sang:</p>

<div class="cpoem17">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O where the winds gather<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The souls of the dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Torcall, my father,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">My soul is led!<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>42]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But a river is here,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And a whirling Sword&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a Woman washing<br /></span>
<span class="i1">By a Ford!<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Torcall Dall was as the last leaf on a tree
at that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you on the boat?&rdquo; he whispered
hoarsely.</p>

<p>But it seemed to him that another voice
answered: &ldquo;<i>Yea, even so.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me, for I have blindness: Is it
peace?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you man, or child, or of the Hidden
People?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a shepherd.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A shepherd? Then, sure, you will guide
me through this wood? And what will be
beyond this wood?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A river.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what river will that be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Deep and terrible. It runs through the
Valley of the Shadow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And is there no ford there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, there is a ford.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who will guide me across that ford?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>43]</a></span>
&ldquo;She.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Washer of the Ford.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But hereat Torcall Dall gave a sore cry
and snatched his hand away, and fled sidelong
into an alley of the wood.</p>

<p>It was moonshine when he lay down,
weary. The sound of flowing water filled
his ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said a voice.</p>

<p>So he rose and went. When the cold
breath of the water was upon his face, the
guide that led him put a fruit into his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eat, Torcall Dall!&rdquo;</p>



<p class="break">He ate. He was no more Torcall Dall.
His sight was upon him again. Out of the
blackness shadows came; out of the shadows,
the great boughs of trees; from the boughs,
dark branches and dark clusters of leaves;
above the branches, white stars; below the
branches, white flowers; and beyond these,
the moonshine on the grass and the moonfire
on the flowing of a river dark and deep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take your harp, O Harper, and sing the
song of what you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>44]</a></span>
Torcall heard the voice, but saw no one.
No shadow moved. Then he walked out
upon the moonlit grass; and at the ford he
saw a woman stooping and washing shroud
after shroud of woven sunbeams: washing
them there in the flowing water, and singing
a low song that he did not hear. He did not
see her face. But she was young, and with
long black hair that fell like the shadow of
night over a white rock.</p>

<p>So Torcall took his harp, and he sang:</p>

<div class="cpoem30">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Glory to the great Gods, it is no Sword I am seeing:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor do I see aught but the flowing of a river.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I see shadows on the flow that are ever fleeing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I see a woman washing shrouds for ever and ever.<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then he ceased, for he heard the woman
sing:</p>

<div class="cpoem30">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Glory to God on high, and to Mary, Mother of Jesus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here am I washing away the sins of the shriven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Torcall of Lochlin, throw off the red sins that ye cherish<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I will be giving you the washen shroud that they wear in Heaven.<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Filled with a great awe, Torcall bowed his
head. Then once more he took his harp,
and he sang:</p>

<div class="cpoem30">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>45]</a></span>
<span class="i0">O well it is I am seeing, Woman of the Shrouds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That you have not for me any whirling of the Sword:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have lost my gods, O woman, so what will the name be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of thee and thy gods, O woman that art Washer of the Ford?<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But the woman did not look up from the
dark water, nor did she cease from washing
the shrouds made of the woven moonbeams.
But he heard this song above the sighing of
the water:</p>

<div class="cpoem30">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It is Mary Magdalene my name is, and I loved Christ.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Christ is the son of God, and Mary the Mother of Heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this river is the river of death, and the shadows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are the fleeing souls that are lost if they be not shriven.<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then Torcall drew nigher unto the stream.
A melancholy wind was upon it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are all the dead of the world?&rdquo;
he said.</p>

<p>But the woman answered not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what is the end, you that are called
Mary?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the woman rose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you cross the Ford, O Torcall the
Harper?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>46]</a></span>
He made no word upon that. But he
listened. He heard a woman singing faint
and low far away in the dark. He drew
more near.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you cross the Ford, O Torcall?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He made no word upon that. But once
more he listened. He heard a little child
crying in the night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, lonely heart of the white one,&rdquo; he
sighed, and his tears fell.</p>

<p>Mary Magdalene turned and looked upon
him.</p>

<p>It was the face of Sorrow she had. She
stooped and took up the tears. &ldquo;They are
bells of joy,&rdquo; she said. And he heard a wild
sweet ringing in his ears.</p>

<p>A prayer came out of his heart. A blind
prayer it was, but God gave it wings. It
flew to Mary, who took and kissed it, and
gave it song.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the Song of Peace,&rdquo; she said. And
Torcall had peace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is best, O Torcall?&rdquo; she asked,
rustling-sweet as rain among the leaves her
voice was&mdash;&ldquo;What is best? The sword, or
peace?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>47]</a></span>
&ldquo;Peace,&rdquo; he answered: and he was white
now, and was old.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take your harp,&rdquo; Mary said, &ldquo;and go
in unto the Ford. But lo, now I clothe you
with a white shroud. And if you fear the
drowning flood, follow the bells that were
your tears: and if the dark affright you,
follow the song of the Prayer that came out
of your heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Torcall the Harper moved into the
whelming flood, and he played a wild strange
air, like the laughing of a child.</p>

<p>Deep silence there was. The moonshine
lay upon the obscure wood, and the darkling
river flowed sighing through the soundless
gloom. The Washer of the Ford stooped
once more. Low and sweet, as of yore and
for ever, over the drowning souls, she sang
her immemorial song.</p>

<span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;This &ldquo;legendary romance&rdquo; is based upon
the ancient and still current (though often hopelessly
contradictory) legends concerning Brighid, or Bride,
commonly known as &ldquo;Muime Chriosd,&rdquo; that is,
the Foster-Mother of Christ. From the universal
honour and reverence in which she was and is held&mdash;second
only in this respect to the Virgin herself&mdash;she
is also called &ldquo;Mary of the Gael.&rdquo; Another
name, frequent in the West, is &ldquo;Brighde-nam-Brat,&rdquo;
that is, St. Bride of the Mantle, a name explained
in the course of my legendary story. Brighid the

<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">B</span>EFORE ever St. Colum came across the
Moyle to the island of Iona, that was
then by strangers called <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Innis-nan-Dhruidhneach</span>,
the Isle of the Druids, and by the
natives Ioua, there lived upon the southeast
slope of Dun-I a poor herdsman, named
D&ugrave;vach. Poor he was, for sure, though it
was not for this reason that he could not win
back to Ireland, green Banba, as he called
it: but because he was an exile thence, and
might never again smell the heather blowing
over <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Sliabh-Gorm</span> in what of old was the
realm of Aoimag.</p>

<p>He was a prince in his own land, though
none on Iona save the Arch-Druid knew
what his name was. The high priest, however,
knew that D&ugrave;vach was the royal
D&ugrave;ghall, called D&ugrave;ghall Donn, the son of
Hugh the King, the son of Art, the son of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>53]</a></span>
Conn. In his youth he had been accused of
having done a wrong against a noble maiden
of the blood. When her child was born he
was made to swear across her dead body that
he would be true to the daughter for whom
she had given up her life, that he would rear
her in a holy place but away from Eir&eacute;, and
that he would never set foot within that land
again. This was a bitter thing for D&ugrave;ghall
Donn to do: the more so as, before the
King, and the priests, and the people, he
swore by the Wind, and by the Moon, and
by the Sun, that he was guiltless of the thing
of which he was accused. There were many
there who believed him because of that
sacred oath: others, too, forasmuch as that
Morna the Princess had herself sworn to the
same effect. Moreover, there was Aodh of
the Golden Hair, a poet and seer, who
avowed that Morna had given birth to an
immortal, whose name would one day be as
a moon among the stars for glory. But the
King would not be appeased, though he
spared the life of his youngest son. So it
was that, by the advice of Aodh of the
Druids, D&ugrave;ghall Donn went northwards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>54]</a></span>
through the realm of Clanadon and so to the
sea-loch that was then called Loch Feobal.
There he took boat with some wayfarers
bound for Alba. But in the Moyle a tempest
arose, and the frail galley was driven
northward, and at sunrise was cast like a
great fish, spent and dead, upon the south
end of Ioua, that is now Iona. Only two
of the mariners survived: D&ugrave;ghall Donn
and the little child. This was at the place
where, on a day of the days in a year that
was not yet come, St. Colum landed in
his coracle, and gave thanks on his bended
knees.</p>

<p>When, warmed by the sun, they rose, they
found themselves in a waste place. Ill was
D&ugrave;ghall in his mind because of the portents,
and now to his astonishment and alarm the
child Bridget knelt on the stones, and, with
claspt hands, small and pink as the sea-shells
round about her, sang a song of words which
were unknown to him. This was the more
marvellous, as she was yet but an infant, and
could say no word even of Erse, the only
tongue she had heard.</p>

<p>At this portent, he knew that Aodh had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>55]</a></span>
spoken seeingly. Truly this child was not
of human parentage. So he, too, kneeled,
and, bowing before her, asked if she were
of the race of the <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Tuatha de Danann</span>, or of
the older gods, and what her will was, that
he might be her servant. Then it was that
the kneeling babe looked at him, and sang
in a low sweet voice in Erse:</p>

<div class="cpoem27">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I am but a little child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">D&ugrave;ghall, son of Hugh, son of Art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But my garment shall be laid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the lord of the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, surely it shall be that He<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The King of the Elements Himself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall lean against my bosom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I will give him peace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And peace will I give to all who ask<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because of this mighty Prince,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And because of his Mother that is the Daughter of Peace.<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And while D&ugrave;ghall Donn was still marvelling
at this thing, the Arch-Druid of Iona
approached, with his white-robed priests.
A grave welcome was given to the stranger,
but while the youngest of the servants of
God was entrusted with the child, the Arch-Druid
took D&ugrave;ghall aside, and questioned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>56]</a></span>
him. It was not till the third day that the
old man gave his decision. D&ugrave;ghall Donn
was to abide on Iona if he so willed: the
child certainly was to stay. His life would
be spared, nor would he be a bondager of
any kind, and a little land to till would be
given him, and all that he might need. But
of his past he was to say no word. His
name was to become as naught, and he was
to be known simply as D&ugrave;vach. The child,
too, was to be named Bride, for that was the
way the name Bridget was called in the
Erse of the Isles.</p>

<p>To the question of D&ugrave;ghall, that was
thenceforth D&ugrave;vach, as to why he laid so
great stress on the child, that was a girl, and
the reputed offspring of shame at that,
Cathal the Arch-Druid replied thus: &ldquo;My
kinsman Aodh of the Golden Hair, who sent
you here, was wiser than Hugh the King
and all the Druids of Aoimag. Truly, this
child is an Immortal. There is an ancient
prophecy concerning her: surely of her who
is now here, and no other. There shall be,
it says, a spotless maid born of a virgin of
the ancient immemorial race in Innisfail.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>57]</a></span>
And when for the seventh time the sacred
year has come, she will hold Eternity in her
lap as a white flower. Her maiden breasts
shall swell with milk for the Prince of the
World. She shall give suck to the King of
the Elements. So I say unto you, D&ugrave;vach,
go in peace. Take unto thyself a wife, and
live upon the place I will give thee on the
east side of Ioua. Treat Bride as though
she were thy spirit, but leave her much
alone, and let her learn of the sun and the
wind. In the fulness of time the prophecy
shall be fulfilled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So was it, from that day of the days.
D&ugrave;vach took a wife unto himself, who
weaned the little Bride, who grew in beauty
and grace, so that all men marvelled. Year
by year for seven years the wife of D&ugrave;vach
bore him a son, and these grew apace in
strength, so that by the beginning of the
third year of the seventh cycle of Bride&rsquo;s
life there were three stalwart youths to
brother her, and three comely and strong
lads, and one young boy fair to see. Nor
did any one, not even Bride herself, saving
Cathal the Arch-Druid, know that D&ugrave;vach
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>58]</a></span>
the herdsman was D&ugrave;ghall Donn, of a
princely race in Innisfail.</p>

<p>In the end, too, D&ugrave;vach came to think
that he had dreamed, or at the least that
Cathal had not interpreted the prophecy
aright. For though Bride was of exceeding
beauty, and of a strange piety that made the
young Druids bow before her as though she
were a b&agrave;ndia, yet the world went on as
before, and the days brought no change.
Often, while she was still a child, he had
questioned her about the words she had said
as a babe, but she had no memory of them.
Once, in her ninth year, he came upon her
on the hillside of Dun-I singing these selfsame
words. Her eyes dreamed afar away.
He bowed his head, and, praying to the
Giver of light, hurried to Cathal. The old
man bade him speak no more to the child
concerning the mysteries.</p>

<p>Bride lived the hours of her days upon the
slopes of Dun-I, herding the sheep, or in
following the kye upon the green hillocks
and grassy dunes of what then as now was
called the Machar. The beauty of the world
was her daily food. The spirit within her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>59]</a></span>
was like sunlight behind a white flower.
The birdeens in the green bushes sang for
joy when they saw her blue eyes. The tender
prayers that were in her heart for all the
beasts and birds, for helpless children, and
tired women, and for all who were old, were
often seen flying above her head in the form
of white doves of sunshine.</p>

<p>But when the middle of the year came
that was, though D&ugrave;vach had forgotten it,
the year of the prophecy, his eldest son,
Conn, who was now a man, murmured
against the virginity of Bride, because of
her beauty and because a chieftain of the
mainland was eager to wed her. &ldquo;I shall
wed Bride or raid Ioua&rdquo; was the message
he had sent.</p>

<p>So one day, before the great fire of the
summer festival, Conn and his brothers reproached
Bride.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Idle are these pure eyes, O Bride, not to
be as lamps at thy marriage-bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Truly, it is not by the eyes that we live,&rdquo;
replied the maiden gently, while to their fear
and amazement she passed her hand before
her face and let them see that the sockets
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>60]</a></span>
were empty. Trembling with awe at this
portent, D&ugrave;vach intervened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the Sun I swear it, O Bride, that thou
shalt marry whomsoever thou wilt and none
other, and when thou willest, or not at all if
such be thy will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And when he had spoken, Bride smiled, and
passed her hand before her face again, and
all there were abashed because of the blue
light as of morning that was in her shining
eyes.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>The still weather had come, and all the
isles lay in beauty. Far south, beyond
vision, ranged the coasts of Eir&eacute;: westward,
leagues of quiet ocean dreamed into unsailed
wastes whose waves at last laved the shores
of Tirna&rsquo;n &Ograve;g, the Land of Eternal Youth:
northward, the spell-bound waters sparkled
in the sunlight, broken here and there by
purple shadows, that were the isles of Staffa
and Ulva, Lunga and the isles of the columns,
misty Coll, and Tiree that is the land beneath
the wave; with, pale blue in the heat-haze,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>61]</a></span>
the mountains of R&ugrave;m called Haleval, Haskeval,
and Oreval, and the sheer Scuir-na-Gillian
and the peaks of the Cuchullins in
remote Skye.</p>

<p>All the sweet loveliness of a late spring
remained, to give a freshness to the glory of
summer. The birds had song to them still.</p>

<p>It was while the dew was yet wet on the
grass that Bride came out of her father&rsquo;s
house, and went up the steep slope of Dun-I.
The crying of the ewes and lambs at the
pastures came plaintively against the dawn.
The lowing of the kye arose from the sandy
hollows by the shore, or from the meadows
on the lower slopes. Through the whole
island went a rapid trickling sound, most
sweet to hear: the myriad voices of twittering
birds, from the dotterel in the sea-weed to
the larks climbing the blue spirals of heaven.</p>

<p>This was the morning of her birth, and
she was clad in white. About her waist was
a girdle of the sacred rowan, the feathery
green leaves of it flickering dusky shadows
upon her robe as she moved. The light upon
her yellow hair was as when morning wakes,
laughing low with joy amid the tall corn. As
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>62]</a></span>
she went she sang, soft as the crooning of a
dove. If any had been there to hear he
would have been abashed, for the words were
not in Erse, and the eyes of the beautiful
girl were as those of one in a vision.</p>

<p>When, at last, a brief while before sunrise,
she reached the summit of the Scuir, that is
so small a hill and yet seems so big in Iona
where it is the sole peak, she found three
young Druids there, ready to tend the sacred
fire the moment the sun-rays should kindle
it. Each was clad in a white robe, with
fillets of oak-leaves; and each had a golden
armlet. They made a quiet obeisance as she
approached. One stepped forward, with a
flush in his face because of her beauty, that
was as a sea-wave for grace, and a flower for
purity, and sunlight for joy, and moonlight
for peace, and the wind for fragrance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou mayst draw near if thou wilt, Bride,
daughter of D&ugrave;vach,&rdquo; he said, with something
of reverence as well as of grave courtesy in
his voice: &ldquo;for the holy Cathal hath said that
the Breath of the Source of All is upon thee.
It is not lawful for women to be here at this
moment, but thou hast the law shining upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>63]</a></span>
thy face and in thine eyes. Hast thou come
to pray?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But at that moment a low cry came from
one of his companions. He turned, and
rejoined his fellows. Then all three sank
upon their knees, and with outstretched arms
hailed the rising of God.</p>

<p>As the sun rose, a solemn chant swelled
from their lips, ascending as incense through
the silent air. The glory of the new day came
soundlessly. Peace was in the blue heaven,
on the blue-green sea, on the green land.
There was no wind, even where the currents
of the deep moved in shadowy purple. The
sea itself was silent, making no more than a
sighing slumber-breath round the white sands
of the isle, or a hushed whisper where the tide
lifted the long weed that clung to the rocks.</p>

<p>In what strange, mysterious way, Bride did
not see; but as the three Druids held their
hands before the sacred fire there was a faint
crackling, then three thin spirals of blue
smoke rose, and soon dusky red and wan
yellow tongues of flame moved to and fro.
The sacrifice of God was made. Out of the
immeasurable heaven He had come, in His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>64]</a></span>
golden chariot. Now, in the wonder and
mystery of His love, He was reborn upon
the world, reborn a little fugitive flame upon
a low hill in a remote isle. Great must be
His love that He could die thus daily in a
thousand places: so great His love that He
could give up His own body to daily death,
and suffer the holy flame that was in the
embers he illumined to be lighted and
revered and then scattered to the four
quarters of the world.</p>

<p>Bride could bear no longer the mystery
of this great love. It moved her to an
ecstasy. What tenderness of divine love
that could thus redeem the world daily:
what long-suffering for all the evil and
cruelty done hourly upon the weeping
earth, what patience with the bitterness of
the blind fates! The beauty of the worship
of Be&rsquo;al was upon her as a golden glory.
Her heart leaped to a song that could
not be sung. The inexhaustible love and
pity in her soul chanted a hymn that was
heard of no Druid or mortal anywhere, but
was known of the white spirits of Life.</p>

<p>Bowing her head, so that the glad tears
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>65]</a></span>
fell warm as thunder-rain upon her hands,
she rose and moved away.</p>

<p>Not far from the summit of Dun-I is a
hidden pool, to this day called the Fountain
of Youth. Hitherward she went, as was her
wont when upon the hill at the break of day,
at noon, or at sundown. Close by the huge
boulder, which hides it from above, she heard
a pitiful bleating, and soon the healing of her
eyes was upon a lamb which had become
fixed in a crevice in the rock. On a crag
above it stood a falcon, with savage cries,
lusting for warm blood. With swift step
Bride drew near. There was no hurt to
the lambkin as she lifted it in her arms.
Soft and warm was it there, as a young babe
against the bosom that mothers it. Then
with quiet eyes she looked at the falcon, who
hooded his cruel gaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no wrong in thee, Seobhag,&rdquo; she
said gently; &ldquo;but the law of blood shall not
prevail for ever. Let there be peace this
morn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And when she had spoken this word, the
wild hawk of the hills flew down upon her
shoulder, nor did the heart of the lambkin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>66]</a></span>
beat the quicker, while with drowsy eyes it
nestled as against its dam. When she stood
by the pool she laid the little woolly creature
among the fern. Already the bleating of it
was sweet against the forlorn heart of a ewe.
The falcon rose, circled above her head, and
with swift flight sped through the blue air.
For a time Bride watched its travelling
shadow: when it was itself no more than a
speck in the golden haze, she turned, and
stooped above the Fountain of Youth.</p>

<p>Beyond it stood then, though for ages past
there has been no sign of either, two quicken-trees.
Now they were gold-green in the
morning light, and the brown-green berries
that had not yet reddened were still small.
Fair to see was the flickering of the long
finger-shadows upon the granite rocks and
boulders.</p>

<p>Often had Bride dreamed through their
foliage; but now she stared in amaze. She
had put her lips to the water, and had started
back because she had seen, beyond her own
image, that of a woman so beautiful that her
soul was troubled within her, and had cried
its inaudible cry, worshipping. When,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>67]</a></span>
trembling, she had glanced again, there was none
beside herself. Yet what had happened?
For, as she stared at the quicken-trees, she
saw that their boughs had interlaced, and
that they now became a green arch. What
was stranger still was that the rowan-clusters
hung in blood-red masses, although the late
heats were yet a long way off.</p>

<p>Bride rose, her body quivering because of
the cool sweet draught of the Fountain of
Youth, so that almost she imagined the water
was for her that day what it could be once
in each year to every person who came to
it, a breath of new life and the strength and
joy of youth. With slow steps she advanced
towards the arch of the quickens. Her heart
beat as she saw that the branches at the
summit had formed themselves into the
shape of a wreath or crown, and that the
scarlet berries dropped therefrom a steady
rain of red drops as of blood. A sigh of joy
breathed from her lips when, deep among the
red and green, she saw the white merle of
which the ancient poets sang, and heard the
exceeding wonder of its rapture, which was
now the pain of joy and now the joy of pain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>68]</a></span>
The song of the mystic bird grew wilder
and more sweet as she drew near. For a
brief while she hesitated. Then, as a white
dove drifted slow before her under and
through the quicken-boughs, a dove white
as snow but radiant with sunfire, she moved
forward to follow, with a dream-smile upon
her face and her eyes full of the sheen of
wonder and mystery, as shadowy waters
flooded with moonshine.</p>

<p>And this was the passing of Bride, who
was not seen again of D&ugrave;vach or her foster-brothers
for the space of a year and a day.
Only Cathal, the aged Arch-Druid, who died
seven days thence, had a vision of her, and
wept for joy.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>When the strain of the white merle ceased,
though it had seemed to her scarce longer
than the vanishing song of the swallow on
the wing, Bride saw that the evening was
come. Through the violet glooms of dusk
she moved soundlessly, save for the crispling
of her feet among the hot sands. Far as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>69]</a></span>
she could see to right or left there were hollows
and ridges of sand; where, here and
there, trees or shrubs grew out of the parched
soil, they were strange to her. She had
heard the Druids speak of the sunlands in
a remote, nigh unreachable East, where there
were trees called palms, trees in a perpetual
sunflood yet that perished not, also tall dark
cypresses, black-green as the holy yew.
These were the trees she now saw. Did
she dream, she wondered? Far down in
her mind was some memory, some floating
vision only, mayhap, of a small green isle
far among the northern seas. Voices, words,
faces, familiar yet unfamiliar when she strove
to bring them near, haunted her.</p>

<p>The heat brooded upon the land. The
sigh of the parched earth was &ldquo;Water,
water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she moved onward through the gloaming
she descried white walls beyond her:
white walls and square white buildings, looming
ghostly through the dark, yet home-sweet
as the bells of the cows on the sea-pastures,
because of the yellow lights every here and
there agleam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>70]</a></span>
A tall figure moved towards her, clad in
white, even as those figures which haunted
her unremembering memory. When he
drew near she gave a low cry of joy. The
face of her father was sweet to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where will be the pitcher, Brighid?&rdquo; he
said, though the words were not the words
that were near her when she was alone.
Nevertheless she knew them, and the same
manner of words was upon her lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My pitcher, father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, dreamer, when will you be taking
heed! It is leaving your pitcher you will
be, and by the Well of the Camels, no doubt:
though little matter will that be, since there
is now no water, and the drought is heavy
upon the land. But ... Brighid ...&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure now it is not safe for you to be on
the desert at night. Wild beasts come out of
the darkness, and there are robbers and wild
men who lurk in the shadow. Brighid ...
Brighid ... is it dreaming you are still?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was dreaming of a cool green isle in
northern seas, where ...&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where you have never been, foolish lass,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>71]</a></span>
and are never like to be. Sure, if any wayfarer
were to come upon us you would scarce
be able to tell him that yonder village is
Bethlehem, and that I am D&ugrave;ghall Donn the
inn-keeper, D&ugrave;ghall the son of Hugh, son of
Art, son of Conn. Well, well, I am growing
old, and they say that the old see wonders.
But I do not wish to see this wonder, that
my daughter Brighid forgets her own town,
and the good inn that is there, and the strong
sweet ale that is cool against the thirst of the
weary. Sure, if the day of my days is near
it is near. &lsquo;Green be the place of my rest,&rsquo;
I cry, even as Ois&igrave;n the son of Fionn of the
hero-line of Trenmor cried in his old age;
though if Ois&igrave;n and the Fi&agrave;nn were here not
a green place would they find now, for the
land is burned dry as the heather after a
hill-fire. But now, Brighid, let us go back
into Bethlehem, for I have that for the saying
which must be said at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In silence the twain walked through the
gloaming that was already the mirk, till they
came to the white gate, where the asses and
camels breathed wearily in the sultry darkness,
with dry tongues moving round parched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>72]</a></span>
mouths. Thence they fared through narrow
streets, where a few white-robed Hebrews
and sons of the desert moved silently, or sat
in niches. Finally, they came to a great yard,
where more than a score of camels lay huddled
and growling in their sleep. Beyond
this was the inn, which was known to all the
patrons and friends of D&ugrave;ghall Donn as the
&ldquo;Rest and Be Thankful,&rdquo; though formerly
as the Rest of Clan-Ailpean, for was he not
himself through his mother MacAlpine of
the Isles, as well as blood-kin to the great
Carmac the Ard-Righ, to whom his father,
Hugh, was feudatory prince?</p>

<p>As D&ugrave;ghall and Bride walked along the
stone flags of a passage leading to the inner
rooms, he stopped and drew her attention
to the water-tanks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look you, my lass,&rdquo; he said sorrowfully,
&ldquo;of these tanks and barrels nearly all are
empty. Soon there will be no water whatever,
which is an evil thing though I whisper
it in peace, to the Stones be it said. Now,
already the folk who come here murmur.
No man can drink ale all day long, and those
wayfarers who want to wash the dust of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>73]</a></span>
their journey from their feet and hands complain
bitterly. And ... what is that you
will be saying? The kye? Ay, sure, there
is the kye, but the poor beasts are o&rsquo;ercome
with the heat, and there&rsquo;s not a Cailliach on
the hills who could win a drop more of milk
from them than we squeeze out of their udders
now, and that only with rune after rune till all
the throats of the milking lassies are as dry
as the salt grass by the sea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what I am saying is this: &rsquo;tis
months now since any rain will be falling,
and every crock of water has been for the
treasuring as though it had been the honey
of Moy-Mell itself. The moon has been full
twice since we had the good water brought
from the mountain-springs; and now they are
for drying up too. The seers say that the
drought will last. If that is a true word, and
there be no rain till the winter comes, there
will be no inn in Bethlehem called &lsquo;The
Rest and Be Thankful;&rsquo; for already there is
not enough good water to give peace even
to your little thirst, my birdeen. As for the
ale, it is poor drink now for man or maid,
and as for the camels and asses, poor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>74]</a></span>
beasts, they don&rsquo;t understand the drinking
of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is true, father; but what is to be
done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I will be telling you, my
lintie. Now, I have been told by an oganach
out of Jerusalem, that lives in another place
close by the great town, that there is a
quenchless well of pure water, cold as the
sea with a north wind in it, on a hill there
called the Mount of Olives. Now, it is to
that hill I will be going. I am for taking all
the camels, and all the horses, and all the
asses, and will lade each with a burthen of
water-skins, and come back home again with
water enough to last us till the drought
breaks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was all that was said that night. But
at the dawn the inn was busy, and all the
folk in Bethlehem were up to see the going
abroad of D&ugrave;ghall Donn and Ronald M&lsquo;Ian,
his shepherd, and some Macleans and Maccallums
that were then in that place. It was
a fair sight to see as they went forth through
the white gate that is called the Gate of
Nazareth. A piper walked first, playing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>75]</a></span>
Gathering of the Swords: then came D&ugrave;ghall
Donn on a camel, and M&lsquo;Ian on a horse, and
the herdsmen on asses, and then there were
the collies barking for joy.</p>

<p>Before he had gone, D&ugrave;ghall took Bride
out of the hearing of the others. There was
only a little stagnant water, he said; and as
for the ale, there was no more than a flagon
left of what was good. This flagon, and
the one jar of pure water, he left with her.
On no account was she to give a drop to any
wayfarer, no matter how urgent he might be;
for he, D&ugrave;ghall, could not say when he would
get back, and he did not want to find a dead
daughter to greet him on his return, let alone
there being no maid of the inn to attend to
customers. Over and above that, he made
her take an oath that she would give no one,
no, not even a stranger, accommodation at
the inn, during his absence.</p>

<p>Afternoon and night came, and dawn and
night again, and yet again. It was on the
afternoon of the third day, when even the
crickets were dying of thirst, that Bride heard
a clanging at the door of the inn.</p>

<p>When she went to the door she saw a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>76]</a></span>
weary gray-haired man, dusty and tired. By
his side was an ass with drooping head, and
on the ass was a woman, young, and of a
beauty that was as the cool shadow of green
leaves and the cold ripple of running waters.
But beautiful as she was, it was not this that
made Bride start: no, nor the heavy womb
that showed the woman was with child. For
she remembered her of a dream&mdash;it was a
dream, sure&mdash;when she had looked into a
pool on a mountain-side, and seen, beyond
her own image, just this fair and beautiful
face, the most beautiful that ever man saw
since Nais, of the Sons of Usna, beheld
Deirdr&ecirc; in the forest,&mdash;ay, and lovelier far
even than she, the peerless among women.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Gu&rsquo;m beannaicheadh Dia an tigh</span>,&rdquo; said
the gray-haired man in a weary voice, &ldquo;the
blessing of God on this house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Soraidh leat</span>,&rdquo; replied Bride gently, &ldquo;and
upon you likewise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you give us food and drink, and, after
that, good rest at this inn? Sure it is grateful
we will be. This is my wife Mary, upon
whom is a mystery: and I am Joseph, a
carpenter in Arimathea.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>77]</a></span>
&ldquo;Welcome, and to you, too, Mary: and
peace. But there is neither food nor drink
here, and my father has bidden me give
shelter to none who comes here against his
return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The carpenter sighed, but the fair woman
on the ass turned her shadowy eyes upon
Bride, so that the maiden trembled with joy
and fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And is it forgetting me you will be,
Brighid-Alona,&rdquo; she murmured, in the good
sweet Gaelic of the Isles, and the voice of her
was like the rustle of leaves when a soft rain
is falling in a wood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, I remember,&rdquo; Bride whispered, filled
with deep awe. Then without a word she
turned, and beckoned them to follow: which,
having left the ass by the doorway, they did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is all the ale that I have,&rdquo; she said,
as she gave the flagon to Joseph: &ldquo;and here,
Mary, is all the water that there is. Little
there is, but it is you that are welcome to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, when they had quenched their thirst
she brought out oatcakes and scones and
brown bread, and would fain have added
milk, but there was none.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>78]</a></span>
&ldquo;Go to the byre, Brighid,&rdquo; said Mary,
&ldquo;and the first of the kye shall give milk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Bride went, but returned saying that
the creature would not give milk without a
sian or song, and that her throat was too dry
to sing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say this <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">sian</i>,&rdquo; said Mary:&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem22">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Give up thy milk to her who calls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across the low green hills of Heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stream-cool meads of Paradise!<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And sure enough, when Bride did this, the
milk came: and she soothed her thirst, and
went back to her guests rejoicing. It was
sorrow to her not to let them stay where they
were, but she could not, because of her oath.</p>

<p>The man Joseph was weary, and said he
was too tired to seek far that night, and
asked if there was no empty byre or stable
where he and Mary could sleep till morning.
At that, Bride was glad: for she knew there
was a clean cool stable close to the byre
where her kye were: and thereto she led
them, and returned with peace at her heart.</p>

<p>When she was in the inn again, she was
afraid once more: for lo, though Mary and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>79]</a></span>
Joseph had drunken deep of the jar and the
flagon, each was now full as it had been.
Of the food, too, none seemed to have been
taken, though she had herself seen them
break the scones and the oatcakes.</p>

<p>It was dusk when her reverie was broken
by the sound of the pipes. Soon thereafter
D&ugrave;ghall Donn and his following rode up to
the inn, and all were glad because of the cool
water, and the grapes, and the green fruits of
the earth, that they brought with them.</p>

<p>While her father was eating and drinking,
merry because of the ale that was still in the
flagon, Bride told him of the wayfarers. Even
as she spoke, he made a sign of silence, because
of a strange, unwonted sound that he
heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What will that be meaning?&rdquo; he asked,
in a low, hushed voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure it is the rain at last, father. That is
a glad thing. The earth will be green again.
The beasts will not perish. Hark, I hear the
noise of it coming down from the hills as
well.&rdquo; But D&ugrave;ghall sat brooding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;is it not foretold
that the Prince of the World is to be born in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>80]</a></span>
this land, during a heavy falling of rain, after
a long drought? And who is for knowing
that Bethlehem is not the place, and that this
is not the night of the day of the days?
Brighid, Brighid, the woman Mary must be
the mother of the Prince, who is to save
all mankind out of evil and pain and
death!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with that he rose and beckoned to
her to follow. They took a lantern, and
made their way through the drowsing camels
and asses and horses, and past the byres
where the kye lowed gently, and so to the
stable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure that is a bright light they are having,&rdquo;
D&ugrave;ghall muttered uneasily: for, truly, it was
as though the shed were a shell filled with
the fires of sunrise.</p>

<p>Lightly they pushed back the door.
When they saw what they saw they fell upon
their knees. Mary sat with her heavenly
beauty upon her like sunshine on a dusk
land: in her lap, a Babe laughing sweet
and low.</p>

<p>Never had they seen a Child so fair. He
was as though wrought of light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>81]</a></span>
&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; murmured D&ugrave;ghall Donn,
of Joseph, who stood near, with rapt eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the Prince of Peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with that Mary smiled, and the Child
slept.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brighid, my sister dear&rdquo;&mdash;and, as she
whispered this, Mary held the little one to
Bride.</p>

<p>The fair girl took the Babe in her arms,
and covered it with her mantle. Therefore
it is that she is known to this day as Brighde-nam-Brat,
St. Bride of the Mantle.</p>

<p>And all through that night, while the
mother slept, Bride nursed the Child, with
tender hands and croodling crooning songs.
And this was one of the songs that she sang:</p>

<p>It was on this night that, far away in Iona,
the Arch-Druid Cathal died. But before the
breath went from him he had his vision of
joy, and his last words were:</p>

<div class="cpoem29">

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>83]</a></span>
At the coming of dawn Mary awoke, and
took the Child. She kissed Bride upon the
brows, and said this thing to her: &ldquo;Brighid,
my sister dear, thou shalt be known unto all
time as Muime Chriosd.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>No sooner had Mary spoken than Bride
fell into a deep sleep. So profound was this
slumber that when D&ugrave;ghall Donn came to
see to the wayfarers, and to tell them that
the milk and the porridge were ready for the
breaking of their fast, he could get no word
of her at all. She lay in the clean, yellow
straw beneath the manger, where Mary had
laid the Child. D&ugrave;ghall stared in amaze.
There was no sign of the mother, nor of the
Babe that was the Prince of Peace, nor of
the douce, quiet man that was Joseph the
carpenter. As for Bride, she not only slept
so sound that no word of his fell against her
ears, but she gave him awe. For as he
looked at her he saw that she was surrounded
by a glowing light. Something in his heart
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>84]</a></span>
shaped itself into a prayer, and he knelt
beside her, sobbing low. When he rose, it
was in peace. Mayhap an angel had comforted
his soul in its dark shadowy haunt of
his body.</p>

<p>It was late when Bride awoke, though she
did not open her eyes, but lay dreaming.
For long she thought she was in Tir-Tairngire,
the Land of Promise, or wandering on
the honey-sweet plain of Magh-Mell; for the
wind of dreamland brought exquisite odours
to her, and in her ears was a most marvellous
sweet singing.</p>

<p>All round her there was a music of rejoicing.
Voices, lovelier than any she had ever
heard, resounded; glad voices full of praise
and joy. There was a pleasant tumult of
harps and trumpets, and as from across blue
hills and over calm water came the sound of
the bagpipes. She listened with tears. Loud
and glad were the pipes, at times full of
triumph, as when the heroes of old marched
with Cuculain or went down to battle with
Fionn: again, they were low and sweet, like
humming of bees when the heather is heavy
with the honey-ooze. The songs and wild
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>85]</a></span>
music of the angels lulled her into peace:
for a time no thought of the woman Mary
came to her, nor of the Child that was her
foster-child.</p>

<p>Suddenly it was in her mind as though the
pipes played the chant that is called the
&ldquo;<span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Aoibhneas a Shlighe</span>,&rdquo; &ldquo;the joy of his way,&rdquo;
a march played before a bridegroom going
to his bride. Out of this glad music came a
solitary voice, like a child singing on the
hillside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The way of wonder shall be thine, O
Brighid-Naomha!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was what the child-voice sang. Then
it was as though all the harpers of the west
were playing &ldquo;air cl&agrave;rsach&rdquo;: and the song
of a multitude of voices was this:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blessed art thou, O Brighid, who nursed
the King of the Elements in thy bosom:
blessed thou, the Virgin Sister of the Virgin
Mother, for unto all time thou shalt be called
Muime Chriosd, the Foster-Mother of Jesus
that is the Christ.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that, Bride remembered all, and
opened her eyes. Naught strange was there
to see, save that she lay in the stable. Then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>86]</a></span>
as she noted that the gloaming had come,
she wondered at the soft light that prevailed
in the shed, though no lamp or candle
burned there. In her ears, too, still lingered
a wild and beautiful music.</p>

<p>It was strange. Was it all a dream, she
pondered. But even as she thought thus,
she saw half of her mantle lying upon the
straw in the manger. Much she marvelled
at this, but when she took the garment in
her hand she wondered more. For though it
was no more than a half of the poor mantle
wherewith she had wrapped the Babe, it was
all wrought with mystic gold lines and with
precious stones more glorious than ever Arch-Druid
or Island Prince had seen. The
marvel gave her awe at last, when, as she
placed the garment upon her shoulder, it
covered her completely.</p>

<p>She knew now that she had not dreamed,
and that a miracle was done. So with gladness
she went out of the stable, and into the
inn. D&ugrave;ghall Donn was amazed when he
saw her, and then rejoiced exceedingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you so merry, my father?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>87]</a></span>
&ldquo;Sure it is glad that I am. For now the
folk will be laughing the wrong way. This
very morning I was so pleased with the
pleasure, that while the pot was boiling on
the peats I went out and told every one I
met that the Prince of Peace was come, and
had just been born in the stable behind the
&lsquo;Rest and Be Thankful.&rsquo; Well, that saying
was just like a weasel among the rabbits,
only it was an old toothless weasel: for all
Bethlehem mocked me, some with jeers,
some with hard words, and some with
threats. Sure, I cursed them right and left.
No, not for all my cursing&mdash;and by the
blood of my fathers, I spared no man among
them, wishing them sword and fire, the black
plague and the gray death&mdash;would they believe.
So back it was that I came, and going
through the inn I am come to the stable.
&lsquo;Sorrow is on me like a gray mist,&rsquo; said
Ois&igrave;n, mourning for Oscur, and sure it was
a gray mist that was on me when not a sign
of man, woman, or child was to be seen, and
you so sound asleep that a March gale in the
Moyle wouldn&rsquo;t have roused you. Well, I
went back and told this thing, and all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>88]</a></span>
people in Bethlehem mocked at me. And
the Elders of the People came at last, and
put a fine upon me: and condemned me to
pay three barrels of good ale, and a sack of
meal, and three thin chains of gold, each
three yards long: and this for causing a false
rumour, and still more for making a laughing-stock
of the good folk of Bethlehem. There
was a man called Murdoch-Dhu, who is the
chief smith in Nazareth, and it&rsquo;s him I&rsquo;m
thinking will have laughed the Elders into
doing this hard thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was then that Bride was aware of a
marvel upon her, for she blew an incantation
off the palm of her hand, and by that frith
she knew where the dues were to be found.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By what I see in the air that is blown off
the palm of my hand, father, I bid you go
into the cellar of the inn. There you will
find three barrels full of good ale, and beside
them a sack of meal, and the sack is tied
with three chains of gold, each three yards
long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But while D&ugrave;ghall Donn went away rejoicing,
and found that which Bride had foretold,
she passed out into the street. None
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>89]</a></span>
saw her in the gloaming, or as she went
towards the Gate of the East. When she
passed by the Lazar-house she took her
mantle off her back and laid it in the place
of offerings. All the jewels and fine gold
passed into invisible birds with healing wings:
and these birds flew about the heads of the
sick all night, so that at dawn every one
arose, with no ill upon him, and went on his
way rejoicing. As each went out of Bethlehem
that morning of the mornings he found
a clean white robe and new sandals at the
first mile; and, at the second, food and cool
water; and, at the third, a gold piece and a
staff.</p>

<p>The guard that was at the Eastern Gate
did not hail Bride. All the gaze of him was
upon a company of strange men, shepherd-kings,
who said they had come out of the
East led by a star. They carried rare gifts
with them when they first came to Bethlehem:
but no man knew whence they came, what
they wanted, or whither they went.</p>

<p>For a time Bride walked along the road
that leads to Nazareth. There was fear in
her gentle heart when she heard the howling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>90]</a></span>
of hyenas down in the dark hollows, and she
was glad when the moon came out and shone
quietly upon her.</p>

<p>In the moonlight she saw that there were
steps in the dew before her. She could see
the black print of feet in the silver sheen on
the wet grass, for it was on a grassy hill that
she now walked, though a day ago every leaf
and sheath there had lain brown and withered.
The footprints she followed were those of a
woman and of a child.</p>

<p>All night through she tracked those wandering
feet in the dew. They were always fresh
before her, and led her away from the villages,
and also where no wild beasts prowled through
the gloom. There was no weariness upon
her, though often she wondered when she
should see the fair wondrous face she sought.
Behind her also were footsteps in the dew,
though she knew nothing of them. They
were those of the Following Love. And this
was the <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Lorgadh-Brighde</span> of which men
speak to this day: the Quest of the holy St.
Bride.</p>

<p>All night she walked; now upon the high
slopes of a hill. Never once did she have a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>91]</a></span>
glimpse of any figure in the moonlight, though
the steps in the dew before her were newly
made, and none lay in the glisten a short way
ahead.</p>

<p>Suddenly she stopped. There were no
more footprints. Eagerly she looked before
her. On a hill beyond the valley beneath
her she saw the gleaming of yellow stars.
These were the lights of a city. &ldquo;Behold, it
is Jerusalem,&rdquo; she murmured, awe-struck, for
she had never seen the great town.</p>

<p>Sweet was the breath of the wind that
stirred among the olives on the mount where
she stood. It had the smell of heather, and
she could hear the rustle of it among the
bracken on a hill close by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Truly, this must be the Mount of Olives,&rdquo;
she whispered. &ldquo;The Mount of which I have
heard my father speak, and that must be the
hill called Calvary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But even as she gazed marvelling, she
sighed with new wonder; for now she saw
that the yellow stars were as the twinkling of
the fires of the sun along the crest of a hill
that is set in the east. There was a living
joy in the dawntide. In her ears was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>92]</a></span>
sweet sound of the bleating of ewes and lambs.
From the hollows in the shadows came the
swift singing rush of the flowing tide. Faint
cries of the herring gulls filled the air; from
the weedy boulders by the sea the skuas
called wailingly.</p>

<p>Bewildered, she stood intent. If only she
could see the footprints again, she thought.
Whither should she turn, whither go? At
her feet was a yellow flower. She stooped
and plucked it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me, O little sun-flower, which way
shall I be going?&rdquo; and as she spoke a small
golden bee flew up from the heart of it, and
up the hill to the left of her. So it is that
from that day the dandelion is called am-B&egrave;arn&agrave;n-Bhrighde.</p>

<p>Still she hesitated. Then a sea-bird flew
by her with a loud whistling cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me, O <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">eisire&ugrave;n</span>,&rdquo; she called, &ldquo;which
way shall I be going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And at this the <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">eisire&ugrave;n</span> swerved in its
flight, and followed the golden bee, crying,
&ldquo;This way, O Bride, Bride, Bride, Bride,
Bri-i-i-ide!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So it is that from that day the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>93]</a></span>
oyster-catcher has been called the Gille-Brighde,
the Servant of St. Bridget.</p>

<p>Then it was that Bride said this sian:</p>

<div class="cpoem28">

</div>

<p>And as she ended she saw before her two
quicken-trees, of which the boughs were interwrought
so that they made an arch.
Deep in the green foliage was a white merle
that sang a wondrous sweet song. Above it
the small branches were twisted into the
shape of a wreath or crown, lovely with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>94]</a></span>
sunlit rowan-clusters, from whose scarlet berries
red drops as of blood fell.</p>

<p>Before her flew a white dove, all aglow as
with golden light.</p>

<p>She followed, and passed beneath the
quicken arch.</p>

<p>Sweet was the song of the merle, that was
then no more; sweet the green shadow of
the rowans, that now grew straight as young
pines. Sweet the far song in the sky, where
the white dove flew against the sun.</p>

<p>Bride looked, and her eyes were glad.
Bonnie the blooming of the heather on the
slopes of Dun-I. Iona lay green and gold,
isled in her blue waters. From the sheiling
of D&ugrave;vach, her father, rose a thin column of
pale blue smoke. The collies, seeing her,
barked loudly with welcoming joy.</p>

<p>The bleating of the sheep, the lowing of
the kye, the breath of the salt wind from the
open sea beyond, the song of the flowing
tide in the Sound beneath: dear the homing.</p>

<p>With a strange light in her eyes she moved
down through the heather and among the
green bracken: white, wonderful, fair to see.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;But now I have grown nothing, being all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the whole world weighs down upon my heart.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<p class="attribute"><span class="smcap">Fergus and the Druid.</span></p>
</div>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN old Sine nic Le&ograve;id came back
to the croft, after she had been to
the burn at the edge of the green <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">airidh</span>,
where she had washed the <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">claar</i> that was for
the potatoes at the peeling, she sat down
before the peats.</p>

<p>She was white with years. The mountain
wind was chill, too, for all that the sun
had shone throughout the midsummer day.
It was well to sit before the peat-fire.</p>

<p>The croft was on the slope of a mountain,
and had the south upon it. North, south,
east, and west, other great slopes reached
upward, like hollow green waves frozen into
silence by the very wind that curved them so,
and freaked their crests into peaks and jagged
pinnacles. Stillness was in that place for
ever and ever. What though the Gorromalt
Water foamed down Ben Nair, where the
croft was, and made a hoarse voice for aye
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>98]</a></span>
surrendering sound to silence? What though
at times the stones fell from the ridges of
Ben Chaisteal and Maolm&ograve;r, and clattered
down the barren declivities till they were
slung in the tangled meshes of whin and
juniper? What though on stormy dawns the
eagle screamed as he fought against the wind
that graved a thin line upon the aged front of
Ben Mulad, where his eyrie was: or that the
kestrel cried above the rabbit-burrows in the
strath: or that the hill-fox barked, or that
the curlew wailed, or that the scattered sheep
made an endless mournful crying? What
were these but the ministers of silence?</p>

<p>There was no blue smoke in the strath
except from the one turf cot. In the hidden
valley beyond Ben Nair there was a hamlet,
and nigh upon three-score folk lived there:
but that was over three miles away. Sine
Macleod was alone in that solitary place, save
for her son Alasdair M&ograve;r &Ograve;g. &ldquo;Young Alasdair&rdquo;
he was still, though the gray feet of fifty
years had marked his hair. Alasdair &Ograve;g he
was while Alasdair Ruadh mac Chalum mhic
Le&ograve;id, that was his father, lived. But when
Alasdair Ruadh changed, and Sine was left a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>99]</a></span>
mourning woman, he that was their son was
Alasdair &Ograve;g still.</p>

<p>She had sore weariness that day. For all
that, it was not the weight of the burden
that made her go in out of the afternoon sun,
and sit by the red glow of the peats, brooding
deep.</p>

<p>When, nigh upon an hour later, Alasdair
came up the slope and led the kye to the
byre, she did not hear him: nor had she
sight of him, when his shadow flickered in
before him and lay along the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor old woman,&rdquo; he said to himself,
bending his head because of the big height
that was his, and he there so heavy and
strong, and tender, too, for all the tangled
black beard and the wild hill-eyes that
looked out under bristling gray-black eyebrows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor old woman, and she with the tired
heart that she has. Ay, ay, for sure the
weeks lap up her shadow, as the sayin&rsquo; is.
She will be thinking of him that is gone.
Ay, or maybe the old thoughts of her are
goin&rsquo; back on their own steps, down this
glen an&rsquo; over that hill an&rsquo; away beyont that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>100]</a></span>
strath, an&rsquo; this corrie an&rsquo; that moor. Well,
well, it is a good love, that of the mother.
Sure a bitter pain it will be to me when
there&rsquo;s no old gray hair there to stroke. It&rsquo;s
quiet here, terrible quiet, God knows, to Himself
be the blessin&rsquo; for this an&rsquo; for that: but
when she has the white sleep at last, then it&rsquo;ll
be a sore day for me, an&rsquo; one that I will not
be able to bear to hear the sheep callin&rsquo;,
callin&rsquo;, callin&rsquo; through the rain on the hills
here, and Gorromalt Water an&rsquo; no other voice
to be with me on that day of the days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She heard a faint sigh, and stirred a moment,
but did not look round.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Muim&rsquo;-&agrave;-ghraidh</span>, is it tired you are, an&rsquo;
this so fine a time, too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a quick gesture, the old woman
glanced at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, child, is that you indeed? Well, I
am glad of that, for I have the trouble again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What trouble, <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Muim&rsquo;-ghaolaiche</span>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the old woman did not answer.
Wearily she turned her face to the peat-glow
again.</p>

<p>Alasdair seated himself on the big wooden
chair to her right. For a time he stayed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>101]</a></span>
silent thus, staring into the red heart of the
peats. What was the gloom upon the old
heart that he loved? What trouble was it?</p>

<p>At last he rose and put meal and water
into the iron pot, and stirred the porridge
while it seethed and sputtered. Then he
poured boiling water upon the tea in the
brown jenny, and put the new bread and the
sweet-milk scones on the rude deal board
that was the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, dear tired old heart,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and let us give thanks to the Being.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blessings and thanks,&rdquo; she said, and
turned round.</p>

<p>Alasdair poured out the porridge, and
watched the steam rise. Then he sat down,
with a knife in one hand and the brown-white
loaf in the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O God,&rdquo; he said, in the low voice he
had in the kirk when the bread and wine were
given&mdash;&ldquo;O God, be giving us now thy blessing,
and have the thanks. And give us peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Peace there was in the sorrowful old eyes
of the mother. The two ate in silence. The
big clock that was by the bed <i>tick-tacked</i>,
<i>tick-tacked</i>. A faint sputtering came out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>102]</a></span>
a peat that had bog-gas in it. Shadows
moved in the silence, and met and whispered
and moved into deep, warm darkness.
There was peace.</p>

<p>There was still a red flush above the hills
in the west when the mother and son sat in
the ingle again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, mother-my-heart?&rdquo; Alasdair
asked at last, putting his great red hand upon
the woman&rsquo;s knee.</p>

<p>She looked at him for a moment. When
she spoke she turned away her gaze again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Foxes have holes, and the fowls of the
air have their places of rest, but the Son of
Man hath not where to lay his head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what then, dear? Sure, it is the
deep meaning you have in that gray old
head that I&rsquo;m loving so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">lennav-aghray</span>, there is meaning to
my words. It is old I am, and the hour of
my hours is near. I heard a voice outside
the window last night. It is a voice I will
not be hearing, no, not for seventy years.
It was cradle-sweet, it was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She paused, and there was silence for a
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>103]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well, dear,&rdquo; she began again, wearily,
and in a low, weak voice, &ldquo;it is more tired
and more tired I am every day now this last
month. Two Sabbaths ago I woke, and
there were bells in the air: and you are for
knowing well, Alasdair, that no kirk-bells
ever rang in Strath Nair. At edge o&rsquo; dark
on Friday, and by the same token the thirteenth
day it was, I fell asleep, and dreamed
the mools were on my breast, and that the
roots of the white daisies were in the hollows
where the eyes were that loved you,
Alasdair, my son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man looked at her with troubled gaze.
No words would come. Of what avail to
speak when there is nothing to be said?
God sends the gloom upon the cloud, and
there is rain: God sends the gloom upon the
hill, and there is mist: God sends the gloom
upon the sun, and there is winter. It is
God, too, sends the gloom upon the soul,
and there is change. The swallow knows
when to lift up her wing over against the
shadow that creeps out of the north: the
wild swan knows when the smell of snow is
behind the sun: the salmon, lone in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>104]</a></span>
brown pool among the hills, hears the deep
sea, and his tongue pants for salt, and his
fins quiver, and he knows that his time is
come, and that the sea calls. The doe
knows when the fawn hath not yet quaked
in her belly: is not the violet more deep in
the shadowy dewy eyes? The woman knows
when the babe hath not yet stirred a little
hand: is not the wild-rose on her cheek more
often seen, and are not the shy tears moist
on quiet hands in the dusk? How, then,
shall the soul not know when the change is
nigh at last? Is it a less thing than a reed,
which sees the yellow birch-gold adrift on the
lake, and the gown of the heather grow russet
when the purple has passed into the sky, and
the white bog-down wave gray and tattered
where the loneroid grows dark and pungent&mdash;which
sees, and knows that the breath of
the Death-Weaver at the Pole is fast faring
along the frozen norland peaks? It is more
than a reed, it is more than a wild doe on
the hills, it is more than a swallow lifting her
wing against the coming of the shadow, it is
more than a swan drunken with the savour
of the blue wine of the waves when the green
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>105]</a></span>
Arctic lawns are white and still. It is more
than these, which has the Son of God for
brother, and is clothed with light. God
doth not extinguish at the dark tomb what
he hath litten in the dark womb.</p>

<p>Who shall say that the soul knows not
when the bird is aweary of the nest, and the
nest is aweary of the wind? Who shall say
that all portents are vain imaginings? A
whirling straw upon the road is but a whirling
straw; yet the wind is upon the cheek
almost ere it is gone.</p>

<p>It was not for Alasdair &Ograve;g, then, to put a
word upon the saying of the woman that
was his mother, and was age-white, and could
see with the seeing of old wise eyes.</p>

<p>So all that was upon his lips was a sigh,
and the poor prayer that is only a breath
out of the heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will be telling me, gray sweetheart,&rdquo;
he said lovingly, at last&mdash;&ldquo;you will be telling
me what was behind the word that you
said: that about the foxes that have holes
for the hiding, poor beasts, and the birdeens
wi&rsquo; their nests, though the Son o&rsquo; Man hath
not where to lay his head?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>106]</a></span>
&ldquo;Ay, Alasdair, my son that I bore long syne
an&rsquo; that I&rsquo;m leaving soon, I will be for telling
you that thing, an&rsquo; now too, for I am knowing
what is in the dark this night o&rsquo; the nights.&rdquo;</p>



<p class="break">Old Sine put her head back wearily on
the chair, and let her hands lie, long and
white, palm-downward upon her knees.
The peat-glow warmed the dull gray that
lurked under her closed eyes and about her
mouth, and in the furrowed cheeks. Alasdair
moved nearer, and took her right hand
in his, where it lay like a tired sheep between
two scarped rocks. Gently he smoothed
her hand, and wondered why so frail and
slight a creature as this small old wizened
woman could have mothered a great swarthy
man like himself&mdash;he a man, now, with his
two score and ten years, and yet but a boy
there at the dear side of her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was this way, Alasdair-mochree,&rdquo; she
went on in her low thin voice,&mdash;like a wind-worn
leaf, the man that was her son thought.
&ldquo;It was this way. I went down to the burn
to wash the <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">claar</i>, and when I was there I
saw a wounded fawn in the bracken. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>107]</a></span>
big sad eyes of it were like those of Maisie,
poor lass, when she had the birthing that
was her going-call. I went through the
bracken, and down by the Gorromalt, and
into the Shadowy Glen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when I was there, and standing by
the running water, I saw a man by the
stream-side. He was tall, but spare and
weary: and the clothes upon him were poor
and worn. He had sorrow. When he lifted
his head at me, I saw the tears. Dark,
wonderful, sweet eyes they were. His face
was pale. It was not the face of a man of
the hills. There was no red in it, and the
eyes looked in upon themselves. He was a
fair man, with the white hands that a woman
has, a woman like the Bantighearna of Glenchaisteal
over yonder. His voice, too, was
a voice like that: in the softness, and the
sweet, quiet sorrow, I am meaning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The word that I gave him was in the
English: for I thought he was like a man
out of Sasunn, or of the southlands somewhere.
But he answered me in the Gaelic:
sweet, good Gaelic like that of the Bioball
over there, to Himself be the praise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>108]</a></span>
&ldquo;&lsquo;And is it the way down the Strath you
are seeking?&rsquo; I asked: &lsquo;and will you not be
coming up to the house yonder, poor cot
though it is, and have a sup of milk, and a
rest if it&rsquo;s weary you are?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You are having my thanks for that,&rsquo; he
said, &lsquo;and it is as though I had both the
good rest and the cool sweet drink. But I
am following the flowing water here.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Is it for the fishing?&rsquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am a Fisher,&rsquo; he said, and the voice
of him was low and sad. He had no hat on
his head, and the light that streamed through
a rowan-tree was in his long hair. He had
the pity of the poor in his sorrowful gray
eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And will you not sleep with us?&rsquo; I
asked again: &lsquo;that is, if you have no place
to go to, and are a stranger in this country,
as I am thinking you are; for I have never
had sight of you in the home-straths before.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am a stranger,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and I have
no home, and my father&rsquo;s house is a great
way off.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do not tell me, poor man,&rsquo; I said gently,
for fear of the pain, &lsquo;do not tell me if you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>109]</a></span>
would fain not; but it is glad I will be if you
will give me the name you have.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My name is Mac-an-t&rsquo;-Saoir,&rsquo; he answered
with the quiet deep gaze that was his.
And with that he bowed his head, and went
on his way, brooding deep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it was with a heavy heart I turned,
and went back through the bracken. A
heavy heart, for sure, and yet, oh peace too,
cool dews of peace. And the fawn was
there: healed, Alasdair, healed, and whinny-bleating
for its doe, that stood on a rock wi&rsquo;
lifted hoof an&rsquo; stared down the glen to where
the Fisher was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I was at the burnside, a woman
came down the brae. She was fair to see,
but the tears were upon her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;have you seen a man
going this way?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ay, for sure,&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;but what
man would he be?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He is called Mac-an-t&rsquo;-Saoir.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, there are many men that are called
Son of the Carpenter. What will his own
name be?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Iosa,&rsquo; she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>110]</a></span>
&ldquo;And when I looked at her, she was weaving
the wavy branches of a thorn near by,
and sobbing low, and it was like a wreath or
crown that she made.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And who will you be, poor woman?&rsquo; I
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;O my Son, my Son,&rsquo; she said, and put
her apron over her head and went down into
the Shadowy Glen, she weeping sore, too, at
that, poor woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So now, Alasdair, my son, tell me what
thought you have about this thing that I
have told you. For I know well whom I
met on the brae there, and who the Fisher
was. And when I was at the peats here
once more I sat down, and my mind sank
into myself. And it is knowing the knowledge
I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, dear, it is sore tired you are.
Have rest now. But sure there are many
men called Macintyre.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, and what Gael that you know will be
for giving you his surname like that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alasdair had no word for that. He rose
to put some more peats on the fire. When
he had done this, he gave a cry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>111]</a></span>
The whiteness that was on the mother&rsquo;s hair
was now in the face. There was no blood
there, or in the drawn lips. The light in the
old, dim eyes was like water after frost.</p>

<p>He took her hand in his. Clay-cold it
was. He let it go, and it fell straight by the
chair, stiff as the cromak he carried when he
was with the sheep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O my God and my God,&rdquo; he whispered,
white with the awe, and the bitter cruel pain.</p>

<p>Then it was that he heard a knocking at
the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; he cried hoarsely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Open, and let me in.&rdquo; It was a low,
sweet voice; but was that gray hour the time
for a welcome?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go, but go in peace, whoever you are.
There is death here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Open, and let me in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that, Alasdair, shaking like a reed in the
wind, unclasped the latch. A tall, fair man,
ill-clad and weary, pale, too, and with dreaming
eyes, came in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Beannachd Dhe an Tigh</i>,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;God&rsquo;s blessing on this house, and on all
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>112]</a></span>
&ldquo;The same upon yourself,&rdquo; Alasdair said,
with a weary pain in his voice. &ldquo;And who
will you be? and forgive the asking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am called Mac-an-t&rsquo;-Saoir, and Iosa is
the name I bear&mdash;Jesus, the Son of the
Carpenter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a good name. And is it good you
are seeking this night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a Fisher.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s here an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s there. But
will you go to the Strath over the hill, and
tell the good man that is there, the minister,
Lachlan MacLachlan, that old Sine nic
Le&ograve;id, wife of Alasdair Ruadh, is dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that, Alasdair &Ograve;g.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how will you be knowing that, and
my name, too, you that are called Macintyre?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I met the white soul of Sine as it went
down by the Shadowy Glen a brief while ago.
She was singing a glad song, she was. She
had green youth in her eyes. And a man
was holding her by the hand. It was Alasdair
Ruadh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that Alasdair fell on his knees. When
he looked up, there was no one there.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>113]</a></span>
Through the darkness outside the door, he saw
a star shining white, and leaping like a pulse.</p>

<p>It was three days after that day of shadow
that Sine Macleod was put under the green
turf.</p>

<p>On each night, Alasdair &Ograve;g walked in the
Shadowy Glen, and there he saw a man fishing,
though ever afar off. Stooping he was,
always, and like a shadow at times. But he
was the man that was called Iosa Mac-an-t&rsquo;-Saoir&mdash;Jesus,
the Son of the Carpenter.</p>

<p>And on the night of the earthing he saw
the Fisher close by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord God,&rdquo; he said, with the hush on
his voice, and deep awe in his wondering
eyes: &ldquo;Lord God!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the Man looked at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Night and day, Alasdair MacAlasdair,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;night and day I fish in the waters of
the world. And these waters are the waters
of grief, and the waters of sorrow, and the
waters of despair. And it is the souls of the
living I fish for. And lo, I say this thing
unto you, for you shall not see me again: <em>Go
in peace.</em> Go in peace, good soul of a poor
man, for thou hast seen the Fisher of Men.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE last time that the Fisher of Men
was seen in Strath Nair was not of
Alasdair Macleod but of the little child, Art
Macarthur, him that was born of the woman
Mary Gilchrist, that had known the sorrow
of women.</p>

<p>He was a little child, indeed, when, because
of his loneliness and having lost his
way, he lay sobbing among the bracken by
the stream-side in the Shadowy Glen.</p>

<p>When he was a man, and had reached the
gloaming of his years, he was loved of men
and women, for his songs are many and
sweet, and his heart was true, and he was a
good man and had no evil against any one.</p>

<p>It is he who saw the Fisher of Men, when
he was but a little lad; and some say that it
was on the eve of the day that Alasdair &Ograve;g
died, though of this I know nothing. And
what he saw, and what he heard, was a moonbeam
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>118]</a></span>
that fell into the dark sea of his mind,
and sank therein, and filled it with light for
all the days of his life. A moonlit mind was
that of Art Macarthur: him that is known
best as Ian M&ograve;r, Ian M&ograve;r of the Hills, though
why he took the name of Ian Cameron is
known to none now but one person, and
that need not be for the telling here. He
had music always in his mind. I asked him
once why he heard what so few heard, but
he smiled and said only: &ldquo;When the heart
is full of love, cool dews of peace rise from
it and fall upon the mind: and that is when
the song of Joy is heard.&rdquo; It must have
been because of this shining of his soul that
some who loved him thought of him as one
illumined. His mind was a shell that held
the haunting echo of the deep seas: and to
know him was to catch a breath of the infinite
ocean of wonder and mystery and beauty
of which he was the quiet oracle. He has
peace now, where he lies under the heather
upon a hillside far away: but the Fisher of
Men will send him hitherward again, to put
a light upon the wave, and a gleam upon the
brown earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>119]</a></span>
I will tell this <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">sgeul</i> as Ian M&ograve;r, that was
the little child Art Macarthur, told it to me.</p>



<p class="break">Often and often it is to me all as a dream
that comes unawares. Often and often have
I striven to see into the green glens of the
mind whence it comes, and whither, in a
flash, in a rainbow gleam, it vanishes. When
I seek to draw close to it, to know whether
it is a winged glory out of the soul, or was
indeed a thing that happened to me in my
tender years, lo&mdash;it is a dawn drowned in day,
a star lost in the sun, the falling of dew.</p>

<p>But I will not be forgetting: no, never;
no, not till the silence of the grass is over my
eyes: I will not be forgetting that gloaming.</p>

<p>Bitter tears are those that children have.
All that we say with vain words is said by
them in this welling spray of pain. I had
the sorrow that day. Strange hostilities
lurked in the familiar bracken. The soughing
of the wind among the trees, the wash
of the brown water by my side, that had
been companionable, were voices of awe.
The quiet light upon the grass flamed.</p>

<p>The fierce people that lurked in shadow had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>120]</a></span>
eyes for my helplessness. When the dark
came I thought I should be dead, devoured of
I knew not what wild creature. Would mother
never come, never come with saving arms, with
eyes like soft candles of home?</p>

<p>Then my sobs grew still, for I heard a
step. With dread upon me, poor wee lad
that I was, I looked to see who came out of
the wilderness. It was a man, tall and thin
and worn, with long hair hanging adown his
face. Pale he was as a moonlit cot on the
dark moor, and his voice was low and sweet.
When I saw his eyes, I had no fear upon me
at all. I saw the mother-look in the gray
shadow of them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And is that you, Art <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">lennavan-mo</span>?&rdquo; he
said, as he stooped and lifted me.</p>

<p>I had no fear. The wet was out of my eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it you will be listening to, now,
my little lad?&rdquo; he whispered, as he saw me
lean, intent, to catch I know not what.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I am not for knowing;
but I thought I heard a music away down
there in the wood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I heard it, for sure. It was a wondrous sweet
air, as of one playing the <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">feadan</span> in a dream.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>121]</a></span>
Callum Dall, the piper, could give no rarer
music than that was; and Callum was a seventh
son, and was born in the moonshine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you come with me this night of the
nights, little Art?&rdquo; the man asked me, with
his lips touching my brow and giving me
rest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I will indeed and indeed,&rdquo; I said.
And then I fell asleep.</p>

<p>When I woke we were in the huntsman&rsquo;s
booth that is at the far end of the Shadowy
Glen.</p>

<p>There was a long rough-hewn table in it,
and I stared when I saw bowls and a great
jug of milk and a plate heaped with oatcakes,
and beside it a brown loaf of rye-bread.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little Art,&rdquo; said he who carried me, &ldquo;are
you for knowing now who I am?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a prince, I&rsquo;m thinking,&rdquo; was the
shy word that came to my mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">lennav-aghray</span>, that is so. It is
called the Prince of Peace I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who is to be eating all this?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the last supper,&rdquo; the prince said,
so low that I could scarce hear; and it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>122]</a></span>
seemed to me that he whispered, &ldquo;for I die
daily, and ever ere I die the Twelve break
bread with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was then I saw that there were six bowls
of porridge on the one side and six on the
other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is your name, O Prince?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Iosa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And will you have no other name than
that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am called Iosa mac Dhe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And is it living in this house you are?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay. But Art, my little lad, I will kiss
your eyes, and you shall see who sup with
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with that the prince that was called
Iosa kissed me on the eyes, and I saw.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will never be quite blind again,&rdquo;
he whispered, and that is why all the long
years of my years I have been glad in my
soul.</p>

<p>What I saw was a thing strange and wonderful.
Twelve men sat at that table, and
all had eyes of love upon Iosa. But they
were not like any men I had ever seen. Tall
and fair and terrible they were, like morning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>123]</a></span>
in a desert place; all save one, who was
dark, and had a shadow upon him and in his
wild eyes.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that each was clad in
radiant mist. The eyes of them were as
stars through that mist.</p>

<p>And each, before he broke bread, or put
spoon to the porridge that was in the bowl
before him, laid down upon the table three
shuttles. Long I looked upon that company,
but Iosa held me in his arms, and I had no
fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are these men?&rdquo; he asked me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Sons of God,&rdquo; I said; I not knowing
what I said, for it was but a child I
was.</p>

<p>He smiled at that. &ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; he spoke
to the twelve men who sat at the table, &ldquo;behold
the little one is wiser than the wisest of
ye.&rdquo; At that all smiled with the gladness
and the joy, save one: him that was in the
shadow. He looked at me, and I remembered
two black lonely tarns upon the hillside,
black with the terror because of the
kelpie and the drowner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are these men?&rdquo; I whispered, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>124]</a></span>
the tremor on me, that was come of the awe
I had.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are the Twelve Weavers, Art, my
little child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what is their weaving?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They weave for my Father, whose web
I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that I looked upon the prince, but I
could see no web.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you not Iosa the Prince?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am the Web of Life, Art <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">lennavan-mo</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what are the three shuttles that are
beside each Weaver?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I know now that when I turned my child&rsquo;s
eyes upon these shuttles I saw that they were
alive and wonderful, and never the same to
the seeing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are called <em>Beauty</em> and <em>Wonder</em> and
<em>Mystery</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with that Iosa mac Dhe sat down and
talked with the Twelve. All were passing
fair, save him who looked sidelong out of
dark eyes. I thought each, as I looked at
him, more beautiful than any of his fellows;
but most I loved to look at the twain who
sat on either side of Iosa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>125]</a></span>
&ldquo;He will be a Dreamer among men,&rdquo;
said the prince; &ldquo;so tell him who ye are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he who was on the right turned his
eyes upon me. I leaned to him, laughing
low with the glad pleasure I had because of
his eyes and shining hair, and the flame as
of the blue sky that was his robe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am the Weaver of Joy,&rdquo; he said. And
with that he took his three shuttles that were
called Beauty and Wonder and Mystery,
and he wove an immortal shape, and it went
forth of the room and out into the green
world, singing a rapturous sweet song.</p>

<p>Then he that was upon the left of Iosa the
Life, looked at me, and my heart leaped.
He, too, had shining hair, but I could not tell
the colour of his eyes for the glory that was
in them. &ldquo;I am the Weaver of Love,&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;and I sit next the heart of Iosa.&rdquo;
And with that he took his three shuttles that
were called Beauty and Wonder and Mystery,
and he wove an immortal shape,
and it went forth of the room and out into
the green world, singing a rapturous sweet
song.</p>

<p>Even then, child as I was, I wished to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>126]</a></span>
look on no other. None could be so passing
fair, I thought, as the Weaver of Joy and the
Weaver of Love.</p>

<p>But a wondrous sweet voice sang in my
ears, and a cool, soft hand laid itself upon
my head, and the beautiful lordly one who
had spoken said, &ldquo;I am the Weaver of Death,&rdquo;
and the lovely whispering one who had lulled
me with rest said, &ldquo;I am the Weaver of
Sleep.&rdquo; And each wove with the shuttles
of Beauty and Wonder and Mystery, and I
knew not which was the more fair, and Death
seemed to me as Love, and in the eyes of
Dream I saw Joy.</p>

<p>My gaze was still upon the fair wonderful
shapes that went forth from these twain,&mdash;from
the Weaver of Sleep, an immortal shape
of star-eyed Silence, and from the Weaver of
Death a lovely Dusk with a heart of hidden
flame&mdash;when I heard the voice of two others
of the Twelve. They were like the laughter
of the wind in the corn, and like the golden
fire upon that corn. And the one said, &ldquo;I
am the Weaver of Passion,&rdquo; and when he
spoke I thought that he was both Love and
Joy, and Death and Life, and I put out my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>127]</a></span>
hands. &ldquo;It is Strength I give,&rdquo; he said;
and he took and kissed me. Then, while
Iosa took me again upon his knee, I saw the
Weaver of Passion turn to the white glory
beside him,&mdash;him that Iosa whispered to
me was the secret of the world, and that was
called &ldquo;The Weaver of Youth.&rdquo; I know not
whence nor how it came, but there was a singing
of skyey birds when these twain took the
shuttles of Beauty and Wonder and Mystery
and wove each an immortal shape, and bade
it go forth out of the room into the green
world, to sing there for ever and ever in the
ears of man a rapturous sweet song.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O Iosa,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;are these all thy
brethren? for each is fair as thee, and all have
lit their eyes at the white fire I see now in
thy heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, before he spake, the room was filled
with music. I trembled with the joy, and in
my ears it has lingered ever, nor shall ever
go. Then I saw that it was the breathing of
the seventh and eighth, of the ninth and the
tenth of those star-eyed ministers of Iosa
whom he called the Twelve: and the names
of them were the Weaver of Laughter, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>128]</a></span>
Weaver of Tears, the Weaver of Prayer, and
the Weaver of Peace. Each rose and kissed
me there. &ldquo;We shall be with you to the
end, little Art,&rdquo; they said: and I took hold
of the hand of one, and cried, &ldquo;O beautiful
one, be likewise with the woman my mother,&rdquo;
and there came back to me the whisper of
the Weaver of Tears: &ldquo;I will, unto the end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, wonderingly, I watched him likewise
take the shuttles that were ever the same
and yet never the same, and weave an immortal
shape. And when this soul of Tears
went forth of the room, I thought it was
my mother&rsquo;s voice singing that rapturous
sweet song, and I cried out to it.</p>

<p>The fair immortal turned and waved to
me. &ldquo;I shall never be far from thee, little
Art,&rdquo; it sighed, like summer rain falling on
leaves: &ldquo;but I go now to my home in the
heart of women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were now but two out of the Twelve.
Oh the gladness and the joy when I looked
at him who had his eyes fixed on the face of
Iosa that was the Life! He lifted the three
shuttles of Beauty and Wonder and Mystery,
and he wove a Mist of Rainbows in that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>129]</a></span>
room; and in the glory I saw that even the
dark twelfth one lifted up his eyes and smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O what will the name of you be!&rdquo; I
cried, straining my arms to the beautiful
lordly one. But he did not hear, for he
wrought Rainbow after Rainbow out of the
mist of glory that he made, and sent each
out into the green world, to be for ever before
the eyes of men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is the Weaver of Hope,&rdquo; whispered
Iosa mac Dhe, &ldquo;and he is the soul of each
that is here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then I turned to the twelfth, and said,
&ldquo;Who art thou, O lordly one with the
shadow in the eyes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But he answered not, and there was silence
in the room. And all there, from the
Weaver of Joy to the Weaver of Peace,
looked down, and said nought. Only the
Weaver of Hope wrought a rainbow, and it
drifted into the heart of the lonely Weaver
that was twelfth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who will this man be, O Iosa mac
Dhe?&rdquo; I whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Answer the little child,&rdquo; said Iosa, and
his voice was sad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>130]</a></span>
Then the Weaver answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am the Weaver of Glory&rdquo;&mdash;he began,
but Iosa looked at him, and he said no
more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Art, little lad,&rdquo; said the Prince of Peace,
&ldquo;he is the one who betrayeth me for ever.
He is Judas, the Weaver of Fear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And at that the sorrowful shadow-eyed
man that was the twelfth took up the three
shuttles that were before him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what are these, O Judas?&rdquo; I cried
eagerly, for I saw that they were black.</p>

<p>When he answered not one of the Twelve
leaned forward and looked at him. It was
the Weaver of Death who did this thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The three shuttles of Judas the Fear-Weaver,
O little Art,&rdquo; said the Weaver of
Death, &ldquo;are called Mystery, and Despair,
and the Grave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with that Judas rose and left the
room. But the shape that he had woven
went forth with him as his shadow: and
each fared out into the dim world, and the
Shadow entered into the minds and into
the hearts of men, and betrayed Iosa that
was the Prince of Peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>131]</a></span>
Thereupon, Iosa rose, and took me by the
hand and led me out of that room. When,
once, I looked back I saw none of the
Twelve save only the Weaver of Hope, and
he sat singing a wild sweet song that he had
learned of the Weaver of Joy, sat singing
amid a mist of rainbows and weaving a
radiant glory that was dazzling as the sun.</p>



<p class="break">And at that I woke, and was against my
mother&rsquo;s heart, and she with the tears upon
me, and her lips moving in a prayer.</p>

<h2>THE DARK NAMELESS ONE</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NE day this summer I sailed with
Padruic Macrae and Ivor McLean,
boatmen of Iona, along the southwestern
reach of the Ross of Mull.</p>

<p>The whole coast of the Ross is indescribably
wild and desolate. From Feenafort
(Fhionn-phort) opposite Balliemore of Icolmkill,
to the hamlet of Earraid Lighthouse, it
were hardly exaggeration to say that the whole
tract is uninhabited by man and unenlivened
by any green thing. It is the haunt of the
cormorant and the seal.</p>

<p>No one who has not visited this region can
realise its barrenness. Its one beauty is the
faint bloom which lies upon it in the sunlight&mdash;a
bloom which becomes as the glow of
an inner flame when the sun westers without
cloud or mist. This is from the ruddy hue
of the granite, of which all that wilderness is
wrought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>136]</a></span>
It is a land tortured by the sea, scourged
by the sea-wind. A myriad lochs, fiords,
inlets, passages, serrate its broken frontiers.
Innumerable islets and reefs, fanged like
ravenous wolves, sentinel every shallow, lurk
in every strait. He must be a skilled boatman
who would take the Sound of Earraid
and penetrate the reaches of the Ross.</p>

<p>There are many days in the months of
peace, as the islanders call the period from
Easter till the autumnal equinox, when Earraid
and the rest of Ross seem under a spell.
It is the spell of beauty. Then the yellow
light of the sun is upon the tumbled masses
and precipitous shelves and ledges, ruddy
petals or leaves of that vast Flower of Granite.
Across it the cloud shadows trail their
purple elongations, their scythe-sweep curves,
and abrupt evanishing floodings of warm
dusk. From wet boulder to boulder, from
crag to shelly crag, from fissure to fissure,
the sea ceaselessly weaves a girdle of foam.
When the wide luminous stretch of waters
beyond&mdash;green near the land, and farther
out all of a living blue, interspersed with
wide alleys of amethyst&mdash;is white with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>137]</a></span>
sea-horses, there is such a laughter of surge
and splash all the way from <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Slugan-dubh</span> to
the <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Rudha-nam-Maol-M&ograve;ra</span>, or to the tide-swept
promontory of the <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Sgeireig-a&rsquo;-Bhochdaidh</span>,
that, looking inland, one sees through
a rainbow-shimmering veil of ever-flying
spray.</p>

<p>But the sun spell is even more fugitive
upon the face of this wild land than the
spell of beauty upon a woman. So runs
one of our proverbs: as the falling of the
wave, as the fading of the leaf, so is the
beauty of a woman, unless&mdash;ah, that <em>unless</em>,
and the indiscoverable fount of joy that can
only be come upon by hazard once in life,
and thereafter only in dreams, and the Land
of the Rainbow that is never reached, and
the green sea-doors of <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Tir-na-thonn</span>, that
open now no more to any wandering wave!</p>

<p>It was from Ivor McLean, on that day,
I heard the strange tale of his kinsman
Murdoch, the tale of &ldquo;The Ninth Wave&rdquo;
that I have told elsewhere. It was Padruic,
however, who told me of the Sea-witch of
Earraid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have heard of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>138]</a></span>
<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">uisge-each</i>&rdquo; (the sea-beast, sea-kelpie, or
water-horse), &ldquo;but I have never seen it
with the eyes. My father and my brother
knew of it. But this thing I know, and this
what we call <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">an-cailleach-uisge</i>&rdquo; (the siren
or water-witch); &ldquo;the <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">cailliach</i>, mind you,
not the <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">maighdeann-mh&agrave;ra</i>&rdquo; (the mermaid),
&ldquo;who means no harm. May she
hear my saying it! The <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">cailliach</span> is old and
clad in weeds, but her voice is young, and
she always sits so that the light is in the
eyes of the beholder. She seems to him
young also, and fair. She has two familiars
in the form of seals, one black as the grave,
and the other white as the shroud that is in
the grave; and these sometimes upset a
boat, if the sailor laughs at the <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">uisge-cailliach</span>&rsquo;s
song.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man netted one of those seals, more
than a hundred years ago, with his herring-trawl,
and dragged it into the boat; but the
other seal tore at the net so savagely, with
its head and paws over the bows, that it was
clear no net would long avail. The man
heard them crying and screaming, and then
talking low and muttering, like women in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>139]</a></span>
a frenzy. In his fear he cast the nets adrift,
all but a small portion that was caught in
the thwarts. Afterwards, in this portion, he
found a tress of woman&rsquo;s hair. And that is
just so: to the Stones be it said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The grandson of this man, Tomais
McNair, is still living, a shepherd on Eilean-Uamhain,
beyond Lunga in the Cairnburg
Isles. A few years ago, off Callachan Point,
he saw the two seals, and heard, though he
did not see, the <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">cailliach</span>. And that which I
tell you,&mdash;Christ&rsquo;s Cross before me&mdash;is
a true thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All the time that Padruic was speaking
I saw that Ivor McLean looked away: either
as though he heard nothing, or did not
wish to hear. There was dream in his eyes;
I saw that, so said nothing for a time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, Ivor?&rdquo; I asked at last, in a
low voice. He started, and looked at me
strangely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What will you be asking that for? What
are you doing in my mind, that is secret?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see that you are brooding over something.
Will you not tell me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell her,&rdquo; said Padruic quietly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>140]</a></span>
But Ivor kept silent. There was a look
in his eyes which I understood. Thereafter
we sailed on, with no word in the boat at all.</p>

<p>That night, a dark, rainy night it was, with
an uplift wind beating high over against the
hidden moon, I went to the cottage where
Ivor McLean lived with his old deaf mother,&mdash;deaf
nigh upon twenty years, ever since
the night of the nights when she heard the
women whisper that Callum, her husband, was
among the drowned, after a death-wind had
blown.</p>

<p>When I entered, he was sitting before the
flaming coal-fire; for on Iona, now, by decree
of MacCailin M&ograve;r, there is no more peat
burned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will tell me now, Ivor?&rdquo; was all
I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; I will be telling you now. And the
reason why I did not tell you before was
because it is not a wise or a good thing to tell
ancient stories about the sea while still on
the running wave. Macrae should not have
done that thing. It may be we shall suffer
for it when next we go out with the nets.
We were to go to-night: but no, not I, no,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>141]</a></span>
no, for sure, not for all the herring in the
Sound.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it an ancient <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">sgeul</i>, Ivor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay. I am not for knowing the age of
these things. It may be as old as the days
of the F&eacute;inn for all I know. It has
come down to us. Alasdair MacAlasdair of
Tiree, him that used to boast of having all
the stories of Colum and Brighde, it was he
told it to the mother of my mother, and
she to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it called?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, this and that; but there is no
harm in saying it is called the Dark Nameless
One.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Dark Nameless One!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is this way. But will you ever have
been hearing of the MacOdrums of Uist?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay: the <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Sliochd-nan-r&ograve;n</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is so. God knows. The <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Sliochd-nan-r&ograve;n</span>
... the progeny of the Seal....
Well, well, no man knows what moves in the
shadow of life. And now I will be telling
you that old ancient tale, as it was given to
me by the mother of my mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="break"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>142]</a></span>
On a day of the days, Colum was walking
alone by the sea-shore. The monks were at
the hoe or the spade, and some milking the
kye, and some at the fishing. They say it
was on the first day of the <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Faoilleach
Geamhraidh</i>, the day that is called <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Am fheill
Brighde</i>.</p>

<p>The holy man had wandered on to where
the rocks are, opposite to Soa. He was
praying and praying, and it is said that
whenever he prayed aloud, the barren egg
in the nest would quicken, and the blighted
bud unfold, and the butterfly cleave its
shroud.</p>

<p>Of a sudden he came upon a great black
seal, lying silent on the rocks, with wicked
eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My blessing upon you, O R&ograve;n,&rdquo; he said
with the good kind courteousness that was
his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Droch spadadh ort</i>,&rdquo; answered the seal.
&ldquo;A bad end to you, Colum of the Gown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, now,&rdquo; said Colum angrily, &ldquo;I am
knowing by that curse that you are no friend
of Christ, but of the evil pagan faith out of the
north. For here I am known ever as Colum
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>143]</a></span>
the White, or as Colum the Saint: and it is
only the Picts and the wanton Normen who
deride me because of the holy white robe
I wear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; replied the seal, speaking
the good Gaelic as though it were the tongue
of the deep sea, as God knows it may be
for all you, I, or the blind wind can say:
&ldquo;Well, well, let that thing be: it&rsquo;s a wave-way
here or a wave-way there. But now if
it is a Druid you are, whether of Fire or of
Christ, be telling me where my woman is,
and where my little daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this, Colum looked at him for a long
while. Then he knew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a man you were once, O R&ograve;n?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe ay and maybe no.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And with that thick Gaelic that you
have, it will be out of the north Isles you
come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a true thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I am for knowing at last who and
what you are. You are one of the race of
Odrum the Pagan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I am not denying it, Colum. And
what is more, I am Angus MacOdrum,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>144]</a></span>
Aonghas mac Torcall mhic Odrum, and the
name I am known by is Black Angus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fitting name too,&rdquo; said Colum the
Holy, &ldquo;because of the black sin in your
heart, and the black end God has in store
for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that Black Angus laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why is there laughter upon you, Man-Seal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it is because of the good company
I&rsquo;ll be having. But, now, give me the
word: are you for having seen or heard aught
of a woman called Kirsteen McVurich?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kirsteen&mdash;Kirsteen&mdash;that is the good
name of a nun it is, and no sea-wanton!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, a name here or a name there is soft
sand. And so you cannot be for telling me
where my woman is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then a stake for your belly, and the
nails through your hands, thirst on your
tongue, and the corbies at your eyne!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, with that, Black Angus louped into
the green water, and the hoarse wild laugh
of him sprang into the air and fell dead
against the cliff like a wind-spent mew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>145]</a></span>
Colum went slowly back to the brethren,
brooding deep. &ldquo;God is good,&rdquo; he said in
a low voice, again and again; and each time
that he spoke there came a fair sweet daisy into
the grass, or a yellow bird rose up, with song
to it for the first time, wonderful and sweet
to hear.</p>

<p>As he drew near to the House of God, he
met Murtagh, an old monk of the ancient
old race of the isles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is Kirsteen McVurich, Murtagh?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was a good servant of Christ, she
was, in the south isles, O Colum, till Black
Angus won her to the sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when was that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nigh upon a thousand years ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that, Colum stared in amaze. But
Murtagh was a man of truth, nor did he
speak in allegories. &ldquo;Ay, Colum my father,
nigh upon a thousand years ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But can mortal sin live as long as
that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, it endureth. Long, long ago, before
Ois&igrave;n sang, before Fionn, before Cuchullin was
a glorious great prince, and in the days when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>146]</a></span>
the <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Tuatha De Danann</span> were sole lords in
all green Banba, Black Angus made the
woman Kirsteen McVurich leave the place
of prayer and go down to the sea-shore, and
there he leaped upon her, and made her his
prey, and she followed him into the sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And is death above her now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. She is the woman that weaves the
sea-spells at the wild place out yonder that
is known as Earraid: she that is called <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">an-Cailleach-uisge</i>,
the sea-witch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why was Black Angus for the seeking
her here and the seeking her there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the Doom. It is Adam&rsquo;s first wife
she is, that sea-witch over there, where the
foam is ever in the sharp fangs of the rocks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who will he be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His body is the body of Angus the son
of Torcall of the race of Odrum, for all that
a seal he is to the seeming; but the soul
of him is Judas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Black Judas, Murtagh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, Black Judas, Colum.&rdquo;</p>



<p class="break">But with that, Ivor McLean rose abruptly
from before the fire, saying that he would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>147]</a></span>
speak no more that night. And truly enough
there was a wild, lone, desolate cry in the
wind, and a slapping of the waves one upon
the other with an eerie laughing sound, and
the screaming of a sea-mew that was like a
human thing.</p>

<p>So I touched the shawl of his mother, who
looked up with startled eyes and said, &ldquo;God
be with us;&rdquo; and then I opened the door,
and the salt smell of the wrack was in my
nostrils, and the great drowning blackness
of the night.</p>

<h3>I<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">THE FESTIVAL OF THE BIRDS</span></h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">B</span>EFORE dawn, on the morning of the
hundredth Sabbath after Colum the
White had made glory to God in Hy, that
was theretofore called Ioua and thereafter
I-shona and is now Iona, the Saint beheld
his own Sleep in a vision.</p>

<p>Much fasting and long pondering over the
missals, with their golden and azure and
sea-green initials and earth-brown branching
letters, had made Colum weary. He had
brooded much of late upon the mystery of
the living world that was not man&rsquo;s world.</p>

<p>On the eve of that hundredth Sabbath,
which was to be a holy festival in Iona, he
had talked long with an ancient graybeard
out of a remote isle in the north, the wild
Isle of the Mountains where Scathach the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>152]</a></span>
Queen hanged the men of Lochlin by their
yellow hair.</p>

<p>This man&rsquo;s name was Ardan, and he was
of the ancient people. He had come to Hy
because of two things. Maolm&ograve;r, the King
of the northern Picts, had sent him to learn
of Colum what was this god-teaching he had
brought out of Eir&eacute;: and for himself he had
come, with his age upon him, to see what
manner of man this Colum was, who had
made Ioua, that was &ldquo;<span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Innis-nan-Dhruidhneach</span>&rdquo;&mdash;the
Isle of the Druids&mdash;into a
place of new worship.</p>

<p>For three hours Ardan and Colum had
walked by the sea-shore. Each learned of
the other. Ardan bowed his head before
the wisdom. Colum knew in his heart that
the Druid saw mysteries. In the first hour
they talked of God. Colum spake, and
Ardan smiled in his shadowy eyes. &ldquo;It is for
the knowing,&rdquo; he said, when Colum ceased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, sure,&rdquo; said the Saint: &ldquo;and now, O
Ardan the wise, is my God thy God?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But at that Ardan smiled not. He turned
the grave, sad eyes of him to the west. With
his right hand he pointed to the Sun that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>153]</a></span>
was like a great golden flower. &ldquo;Truly, He
is thy God and my God.&rdquo; Colum was silent.
Then he said: &ldquo;Thee and thine, O Ardan,
from Maolm&ograve;r the Pictish king to the least of
thy slaves, shall have a long weariness in Hell.
That fiery globe yonder is but the Lamp of the
World: and sad is the case of the man who
knows not the torch from the torch-bearer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And in the second hour they talked of
Man. Ardan spake, and Colum smiled in his
deep, gray eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is for laughter that,&rdquo; he said, when
Ardan ceased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why will that be, O Colum of Eir&eacute;?&rdquo;
said Ardan. Then the smile went out of
Colum&rsquo;s gray eyes, and he turned and looked
about him.</p>

<p>He beheld, near, a crow, a horse, and a
hound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These are thy brethren,&rdquo; he said scornfully.</p>

<p>But Ardan answered quietly, &ldquo;Even so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The third hour they talked about the
beasts of the earth and the fowls of the air.</p>

<p>At the last Ardan said: &ldquo;The ancient
wisdom hath it that these are the souls of men
and women, that have been, or are to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>154]</a></span>
Whereat Colum answered: &ldquo;The new
wisdom, that is old as eternity, declareth
that God created all things in love. Therefore
are we at one, O Ardan, though we sail to
the Isle of Truth from the West and the East.
Let there be peace between us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peace,&rdquo; said Ardan.</p>

<p>That eve, Ardan of the Picts sat with the
monks of Iona. Colum blessed him and said
a saying. Oran of the Songs sang a hymn
of beauty. Ardan rose, and put the wine of
guests to his lips, and chanted this rune:</p>

<p>No more would Ardan say after that,
though all besought him.</p>

<p>Many pondered long that night. Oran
made a song of mystery. Colum brooded
through the dark; but before dawn he slept
upon the fern that strewed his cell. At dawn,
with waking eyes, and weary, he saw his Sleep
in a vision.</p>

<p>It stood gray and wan beside him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What art thou, O Spirit?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>156]</a></span>
&ldquo;I am thy Sleep, Colum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And is it peace?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What wouldest thou?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have wisdom. Thy heart and thy
brain were closed. I could not give you
what I brought. I brought wisdom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Behold!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Colum, sitting upon the strewed fern
that was his bed, rubbed his eyes that were
heavy with weariness and fasting and long
prayer. He could not see his Sleep now.
It was gone, as smoke that is licked up by
the wind.</p>

<p>But on the ledge of the hole that was in
the eastern wall of his cell he saw a bird.
He leaned his elbow upon the <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">leabhar-aifrionn</span>
that was by his side.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Then he spoke.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>
The &ldquo;<span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">leabhar-aifrionn</span>&rdquo; (pron. lyo-ur-eff-runn)
is a missal: literally a mass-book, or chapel-book.
<span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Bru-dhearg</span> is literally red-breast.</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Is there song upon thee, O <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Bru-dhearg</span>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the Redbreast sang, and the singing
was so sweet that tears came into the eyes of
Colum, and he thought the sunlight that was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>157]</a></span>
streaming from the east was melted into that
lilting sweet song. It was a hymn that the
<span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Bru-dhearg</span> sang, and it was this:</p>

</div>

<p>And at that Colum rose. Awe was upon
him, and joy.</p>

<p>He went out, and told all to the monks.
Then he said Mass out on the green sward.
The yellow sunshine was warm upon his gray
hair. The love of God was warm in his
heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, all ye birds!&rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p>And lo, all the birds of the air flew nigh.
The golden eagle soared from the Cuchullins
in far-off Skye, and the osprey from the
wild lochs of Mull; the gannet from above
the clouds, and the fulmar and petrel from
the green wave: the cormorant and the skua
from the weedy rock, and the plover and the
kestrel from the machar: the corbie and the
raven from the moor, and the snipe and the
bittern and the heron: the cuckoo and cushat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>159]</a></span>
from the woodland; the crane from the
swamps, the lark from the sky, and the
mavis and the merle from the green bushes:
the yellowyite, the shilfa, and the lintie, the
gyalvonn and the wren and the redbreast, one
and all, every creature of the wings, they
came at the bidding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peace!&rdquo; cried Colum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peace!&rdquo; cried all the Birds, and even
the Eagle, the Kestrel, the Corbie, and the
Raven cried <em>Peace, Peace!</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;I will say the Mass,&rdquo; said Colum the
White.</p>

<p>And with that he said the Mass. And he
blessed the birds. When the last chant was
sung, only <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Bru-dhearg</span> remained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, O Ruddy-Breast,&rdquo; said Colum,
&ldquo;and sing to us of the Christ.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Through a golden hour thereafter the Redbreast
sang. Sweet was the joy of it.</p>

<p>At the end, Colum said &ldquo;Peace! In
the Name of the Father, the Son, and the
Holy Ghost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thereat Ardan the Pict bowed his head,
and in a loud voice repeated&mdash;&ldquo;<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">S&igrave;th</i> (shee)!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>160]</a></span>
<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">An ainm an Athar, &rsquo;s an mhic, &rsquo;s an Spioraid

<p>And to this day the song of the Birds of
Colum, as they are called in Hy, is <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">S&igrave;th&mdash;S&igrave;th&mdash;S&igrave;th&mdash;an&mdash;ainm&mdash;Chriosd</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Peace&mdash;Peace&mdash;Peace&mdash;in
the name of Christ!&rdquo;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>161]</a></span></p>

<h3>II<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">THE SABBATH OF THE FISHES AND THE
FLIES</span></h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>OR three days Colum had fasted, save
for a mouthful of meal at dawn, a
piece of rye-bread at noon, and a mouthful
of dulse and spring-water at sundown. On
the night of the third day, Oran and Keir
came to him in his cell. Colum was on his
knees, lost in prayer. There was no sound
there, save the faint whispered muttering of
his lips, and on the plastered wall the weary
buzzing of a fly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master!&rdquo; said Oran in a low voice, soft
with pity and awe, &ldquo;Master!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Colum took no notice. His lips still
moved, and the tangled hairs below his
nether lip shivered with his failing breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; said Keir, tender as a woman,
&ldquo;Father!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>162]</a></span>
Colum did not turn his eyes from the
wall. The fly droned his drowsy hum upon
the rough plaster. It crawled wearily for a
space, then stopped. The slow hot drone
filled the cell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master,&rdquo; said Oran, &ldquo;it is the will of
the brethren that you break your fast. You
are old, and God has your glory. Give us
peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; urged Keir, seeing that Colum
kneeled unnoticingly, his lips still moving
above his black beard, with the white hair
of him falling about his head like a snowdrift
slipping from a boulder. &ldquo;Father, be
pitiful! We hunger and thirst for your presence.
We can fast no longer, yet have we
no heart to break our fast if you are not
with us. Come, holy one, and be of our
company, and eat of the good broiled fish
that awaiteth us. We perish for the benediction
of thine eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then it was that Colum rose, and walked
slowly towards the wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little black beast,&rdquo; he said to the fly
that droned its drowsy hum and moved not
at all; &ldquo;little black beast, sure it is well I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>163]</a></span>
am knowing what you are. You are thinking
you are going to get my blessing, you
that have come out of hell for the soul of
me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that the fly flew heavily from the wall,
and slowly circled round and round the head
of Colum the White.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What think you of that, brother Oran,
brother Keir?&rdquo; he asked in a low voice,
hoarse because of his long fast and the
weariness that was upon him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a fiend,&rdquo; said Oran.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is an angel,&rdquo; said Keir.</p>

<p>Thereupon the fly settled upon the wall
again, and again droned his drowsy hot hum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little black beast,&rdquo; said Colum, with the
frown coming down into his eyes, &ldquo;is it for
peace you are here, or for sin? Answer, I
conjure you in the name of the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Ghost!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">An ainm an Athar, &rsquo;s an Mhic, &rsquo;s an
Spioraid Naoimh</i>,&rdquo; repeated Oran below his
breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">An ainm an Athar, &rsquo;s an Mhic, &rsquo;s an
Spioraid Naoimh</i>,&rdquo; repeated Keir below his
breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>164]</a></span>
Then the fly that was upon the wall flew
up to the roof and circled to and fro. And
it sang a beautiful song, and its song was this:</p>

<div class="cpoem30">
<div class="poem">
<p class="center">I</p>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Praise be to God, and a blessing too at that, and a blessing!<br /></span>

<p class="center">

IV</p>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And this is the thought that moves in his brain, as a cloud filled with thunder<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moves through the vast hollow sky filled with the dust of the stars:<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>What boots it the glory of Colum, since he maketh a Sabbath to bless me,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And hath no thought of my sons in the deeps of the air and the sea?</i><br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And with that the fly passed from their
vision. In the cell was a most wondrous
sweet song, like the sound of far-off pipes
over water.</p>

<p>Oran said in a low voice of awe, &ldquo;O our
God!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keir whispered, white with fear, &ldquo;O God,
my God!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Colum rose, and took a scourge from
where it hung on the wall. &ldquo;It shall be for
peace, Oran,&rdquo; he said, with a grim smile
flitting like a bird above the nest of his black
beard; &ldquo;it shall be for peace, Keir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with that he laid the scourge heavily
upon the bent backs of Keir and Oran, nor
stayed his hand, nor let his three days&rsquo; fast
weaken the deep piety that was in the might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>166]</a></span>
of his arm, and because of the glory to
God.</p>

<p>Then, when he was weary, peace came
into his heart, and he sighed &ldquo;<em>Amen!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; said Oran the monk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; said Keir the monk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And this thing hath been done,&rdquo; said
Colum, &ldquo;because of the evil wish of you and
the brethren, that I should break my fast,
and eat of fish, till God willeth it. And lo,
I have learned a mystery. Ye shall all witness
to it on the morrow, which is the
Sabbath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That night the monks wondered much.
Only Oran and Keir cursed the fishes in the
deeps of the sea and the flies in the deeps
of the air.</p>

<p>On the morrow, when the sun was yellow
on the brown sea-weed, and there was peace
on the isle and upon the waters, Colum and
the brotherhood went slowly towards the sea.</p>

<p>At the meadows that are close to the sea,
the Saint stood still. All bowed their heads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O winged things of the air,&rdquo; cried Colum,
&ldquo;draw near!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that the air was full of the hum of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>167]</a></span>
innumerous flies, midges, bees, wasps, moths,
and all winged insects. These settled upon
the monks, who moved not, but praised God
in silence. &ldquo;Glory and praise to God,&rdquo;
cried Colum, &ldquo;behold the Sabbath of the
children of God that inhabit the deeps of the
air! Blessing and peace be upon them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peace! Peace!&rdquo; cried the monks, with
one voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the name of the Father, the Son, and
the Holy Ghost!&rdquo; cried Colum the White,
glad because of the glory to God.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">An ainm an Athar, &rsquo;s an Mhic, &rsquo;s an
Spioraid Naoimh</i>,&rdquo; cried the monks, bowing
reverently, and Oran and Keir deepest of
all, because they saw the fly that was of
Colum&rsquo;s cell leading the whole host, as
though it were their captain, and singing to
them a marvellous sweet song.</p>

<p>Oran and Keir testified to this thing, and
all were full of awe and wonder, and Colum
praised God.</p>

<p>Then the Saints and the brotherhood
moved onward and went upon the rocks.
When all stood ankle-deep in the sea-weed
that was swaying in the tide, Colum cried:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>168]</a></span>
&ldquo;O finny creatures of the deep, draw
near!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with that the whole sea shimmered as
with silver and gold.</p>

<p>All the fishes of the sea, and the great
eels, and the lobsters and the crabs, came in
a swift and terrible procession. Great was
the glory.</p>

<p>Then Colum cried, &ldquo;O fishes of the Deep,
who is your king?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whereupon the herring, the mackerel, and
the dog-fish swam forward, and each claimed
to be king. But the echo that ran from
wave to wave said, <em>The Herring is King</em>.</p>

<p>Then Colum said to the mackerel: &ldquo;Sing
the song that is upon you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the mackerel sang the song of the
wild rovers of the sea, and the lust of
pleasure.</p>

<p>Then Colum said, &ldquo;But for God&rsquo;s mercy,
I would curse you, O false fish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he spake likewise to the dog-fish:
and the dog-fish sang of slaughter and the
chase, and the joy of blood.</p>

<p>And Colum said: &ldquo;Hell shall be your
portion.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>169]</a></span>
And there was peace. And the Herring
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the name of the Father, the Son, and
the Holy Ghost!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whereat all that mighty multitude, ere
they sank into the deep, waved their fins and
their claws, each after his kind, and repeated
as with one voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">An ainm an Athar, &rsquo;s an Mhic, &rsquo;s an
Spioraid Naoimh!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the glory that was upon the Sound of
Iona was as though God trailed a starry net
upon the waters, with a shining star in every
little hollow, and a flowing moon of gold on
every wave.</p>

<p>Then Colum the White put out both his
arms, and blessed the children of God that
are in the deeps of the sea and that are in
the deeps of the air.</p>

<p>That is how Sabbath came upon all living
things upon Hy that is called Iona, and
within the air above Hy, and within the sea
that is around Hy.</p>

<p>And the glory is Colum&rsquo;s.</p>

<h3>III<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">THE MOON-CHILD</span></h3>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> YEAR and a day before God bade
Colum arise to the Feast of Eternity,
P&ograve;l the Freckled, the youngest of the brethren,
came to him, on a night of the nights.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The moon is among the stars, O Colum.
By his own will, and yours, old Murtagh that
is this day with God, is to be laid in the deep
dry sand at the east end of the isle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the holy Saint rose from his bed of
weariness, and went and blessed the place
that Murtagh lay in, and bade neither the
creeping worm nor any other creature to touch
the sacred dead. &ldquo;Let God only,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;let God alone strip that which he made to
grow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But on his way back sleep passed from him.
The sweet salt smell of the sea was in his
nostrils; he heard the running of a wave in
all his blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>171]</a></span>
At the cells he turned, and bade the brethren
go in. &ldquo;Peace be with you,&rdquo; he sighed
wearily.</p>

<p>Then he moved downwards to the sea.</p>

<p>A great tenderness, of late, was upon
Colum the Bishop. Ever since he had blessed
the fishes and the flies, the least of the children
of God, his soul had glowed in a whiter
flame. There were deep seas of compassion
in his gray-blue eyes. One night he had
waked, because God was there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O Christ,&rdquo; he cried, bowing low his old
gray head. &ldquo;Sure, ah sure, the gladness and
the joy, because of the hour of the hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But God said: &ldquo;Not so, Colum, who
keepest me upon the Cross. It is Murtagh,
Murtagh the druid that was, whose soul I am
taking to the glory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that Colum rose in awe and great
grief. There was no light in his cell. In
the deep darkness, his spirit quailed. But
lo, the beauty of his heart wrought a soft
gleam about him, and in that moonshine of
good deeds he rose and made his way to
where Murtagh slept.</p>

<p>The old monk slept indeed. It was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>172]</a></span>
sweet breath he drew&mdash;he, young and fair
now, and laughing with peace under the
apples in Paradise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O Murtagh,&rdquo; Colum cried, &ldquo;and thee I
thought the least of the brethren, because
that thou wast a druid, and loved not to see
thy pagan kindred put to the sword if they
would not repent. But, true, in my years I
am becoming as a boy who learns, knowing
nothing. God wash the sin of pride out of
my life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that a soft white shining, as of one
winged and beautiful, stood beside the dead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Art thou Murtagh?&rdquo; whispered Colum,
in deep awe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I am not Murtagh,&rdquo; came as the
breath of vanishing song.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What art thou?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am Peace,&rdquo; said the glory.</p>

<p>Thereupon Colum sank to his knees, sobbing
with joy, for the sorrow that had been
and was no more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me, O White Peace,&rdquo; he murmured,
&ldquo;can Murtagh hearken there under the
apples, where God is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s love is a wind that blows hitherward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>173]</a></span>
and hence. Speak, and thou shalt
hear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Colum spake. &ldquo;O Murtagh my brother,
tell me in what way it is that I still keep God
crucified upon the Cross.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a sound in the cell as of the
morning-laughter of children, of the singing
of birds, of the sunlight streaming through
the blue fields of Heaven.</p>

<p>Then Murtagh&rsquo;s voice came out of Paradise,
sweet with the sweetness: honey-sweet
it was, and clothed with deep awe because
of the glory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Colum, servant of Christ, arise!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Colum rose, and was as a leaf there, a
leaf that is in the wind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Colum, thine hour has not yet come. I
see it, bathing in the white light which is the
Pool of Eternal Life, that is in the abyss
where deep-rooted are the Gates of Heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And my sin, O Murtagh, my sin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God is weary because thou hast not
repented.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O my God and my God! Sure,
Murtagh, if that is so, it is so, but it is not for
knowledge to me. Sure, O God, it is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>174]</a></span>
blessing I have put on man and woman, on
beast and bird and fish, on creeping things
and flying things, on the green grass and the
brown earth and the flowing wave, on the
wind that cometh and goeth, and on the
mystery of the flame! Sure, O God, I have
sorrowed for all my sins: there is not one I
have not fasted and prayed for. Sorrow upon
me!&mdash;Is it accursed I am, or what is the
evil that holdeth me by the hand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Murtagh, calling through sweet
dreams and the rainbow-rain of happy tears
that make that place so wondrous and so
fair, spake once more:</p>

<p>&ldquo;O Colum, blind art thou. Hast thou
yet repented because that after thou didst
capture the great black seal, that is a man
under spells, thou, with thy monks, didst
crucify him upon the great rock at the place
where, long ago, thy coracle came ashore?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O Murtagh, favoured of God, will you
not be explaining to Him that is King of the
Elements, that this was because the seal who
was called Black Angus wrought evil upon a
mortal woman, and that of the sea-seed was
sprung one who had no soul?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>175]</a></span>
But no answer came to that, and when
Colum looked about him, behold there was
no soft shining, but only the body of Murtagh
the old monk. With a heavy heart, and
his soul like a sinking boat in a sea of pain,
he turned and went out into the night.</p>

<p>A fine, wonderful night it was. The moon
lay low above the sea, and all the flowing
gold and flashing silver of the rippling running
water seemed to be a flood going that
way and falling into the shining hollow
splendour.</p>

<p>Through the sea-weed the old Saint moved,
weary and sad. When he came to a sandy
place he stopped. There, on a rock, he saw
a little child. Naked she was, though clad
with soft white moonlight. In her hair were
brown weeds of the sea, gleaming golden
because of the glow. In her hands was a
great shell, and at that shell was her mouth.
And she was singing this song; passing sweet
to hear, it was, with the sea-music that was
in it:</p>

<div class="cpoem24">

</div>

<p>Softly Colum drew nigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peace,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Peace, little one.
Ah, tender little heart, peace!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The child looked at him with wide sea-dusky
eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it Colum the Holy you will be?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>177]</a></span>
&ldquo;No, my fawn, my white dear babe: it is
not Colum the Holy I am, but Colum the
poor fool that knew not God!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it you, O Colum, that put the sorrow
on my mother, who is the Sea-woman that
lives in the whirlpool over there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, God forgive me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it you, O Colum, that crucified the
seal that was my father: him that was a man
once, and that was called Black Angus?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, God forgive me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it you, O Colum, that bade the children
of Hy run away from me, because I
was a moon-child, and might win them by
the sea-spell into the green wave?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, God forgive me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, dear Colum, it was to the glory of
God, it was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, he knoweth it, and can hear it, too,
from Murtagh, who died this night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And at that Colum looked, and in a moon-gold
wave he saw Black Angus, the seal-man,
drifting dark, and the eyes in his round head
were the eyes of love. And beside the man-seal
swam a woman fair to see, and she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>178]</a></span>
looked at him with joy, and with joy at the
Moon-Child that was her own, and at Colum
with joy.</p>

<p>Thereupon Colum fell upon his knees and
cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me thy sorrow, wild woman of the
sea!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peace to you, Colum,&rdquo; she answered, and
sank into the shadow-thridden wave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me thy death and crucifixion, O
Angus-<span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">dhu</span>!&rdquo; cried the Saint, shaking with
the sorrow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peace to you, Colum,&rdquo; answered the
man-seal, and sank into the dusky quietudes
of the deep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, bitter heart o&rsquo; me! Teach me the
way to God, O little child,&rdquo; cried Colum the
old, turning to where the Moon-Child was!</p>

<p>But lo, the glory and the wonder!</p>

<p>It was a little naked child that looked at
him with healing eyes, but there were no seaweeds
in her hair, and no shell in the little
wee hands of her. For now, it was a male
Child that was there, shining with a light
from within: and in his fair sunny hair was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>179]</a></span>
shadowy crown of thorns, and in his hand was
a pearl of great price.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O Christ, my God,&rdquo; said Colum, with
failing voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is thine now, O Colum,&rdquo; said the
Moon-Child, holding out to him the shining
pearl of great price.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, O Lord my God?&rdquo; whispered
the old servant of God that was now glad
with the gladness: &ldquo;what is this, thy boon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perfect Peace.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center"><i>And that is all.</i><br />
(<i>To God be the Glory. &nbsp; Amen.</i>)</p>

<h2>THE ANNIR-CHOILLE</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN Cathal mac Art, that was called
Cathal Gille-Muire, Cathal the Servant
of Mary, walked by the sea, one night
of the nights in a green May, there was
trouble in his heart.</p>

<p>It was not long since he had left Iona.
The good St. Colum, in sending the youth to
the Isle of &Acirc;-rinn, as it was then called, gave
him a writing for St. Molios, the holy man
who lived in the sea-cave of the small Isle
of the Peak, that is in the eastward hollow at
the south end of Arran. A sorrow it was to
him to leave the fair isle in the west. He
had known glad years there&mdash;since, in one
of the remote isles to the north, he had seen
his father slain by a man of Lochlin, and his
mother carried away in a galley oared by
fierce yellow-haired men. No kith or kin
had he but the old priest, that was the
brother of his father, Cathal Gille-Chriosd,
Cathal the Servant of Christ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>184]</a></span>
On Iona he had learned the way of Christ.
He had a white robe; and could, with a
shaven stick and a thin tuft of seal-fur, or
with the feather-quill of a wild swan or a
solander, write the holy words upon strained
lambskin or parchment, and fill the big letters,
that were here and there, with earth-brown
and sky-blue and shining green, with scarlet
of blood and gold of sun-warm sands. He
could sing the long holy hymns, too, that
Colum loved to hear; and it was his voice
that had the sweetest clear-call of any on the
island. He was in the nineteenth year of
his years when a Frankish prince, who had
come to Iona for the blessing of the Saint,
wanted him to go back with him to the
Southlands. He promised many things because
of that voice. Cathal dreamed often,
in the hot drowsy afternoons of the month
that followed, of the long white sword that
would slay so well; and of the white money
that might be his to buy fair apparel with,
and a great black stallion accoutred with
trappings wrought with gold, and a bed of
down; and of white hands, and white breasts,
and the white song of youth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>185]</a></span>
He had not gone with the Frankish prince,
nor wished to go. But he dreamed often.
It was on a day of dream that he lay on his
back in the hot grass upon a dune, near
where the cells of the monks were. The sun-glow
bathed the isle in a golden haze. The
strait was a shimmering dazzle, and the blue
wavelets that made curves in the soft white
sand seem to spill gold flakes and change
them straightway into little jets of foam or
bubbles of rainbow-spray. Cathal had made
a song for his delight. His pain was less
when he had made it. Now, lying there,
and dreaming at times of the words of the
Frankish prince, and remembering at times
the stranger words of the old pagan helot,
Neis, who had come with him out of the
north, he felt fire burn in his veins, and he
sang:</p>

<div class="cpoem30">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O where in the north, or where in the south, or where in the east or west<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is she who hath the flower-white hands and the swandown breast?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O, if she be west, or east she be, or in the north or south,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sword will leap, a horse will prance, ere I win to Honey-Mouth.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>186]</a></span>
<span class="i0">She has great eyes, like the doe on the hill, and warm and sweet she is,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O, come to me, Honey-Mouth, bend to me, Honey-Mouth, give me thy kiss!<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><em>White Hands</em> her name is, where she reigns amid the princes fair:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White hands she moves like swimming swans athrough her dusk-wave hair:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White hands she puts about my heart, white hands fan up my breath:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White hands take out the heart of me, and grant me life or death!<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">White hands make better songs than hymns, white hands are young and sweet:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O, a sword for me, O Honey-Mouth, and a war-horse fleet!<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O wild sweet eyes! O glad wild eyes! O mouth, how sweet it is!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O, come to me, Honey-Mouth! bend to me, Honey-Mouth! give me thy kiss!<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When he had ceased he saw a shadow fall
upon the white sand beyond the dune. He
looked up, and beheld Colum the Saint.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who taught you that song?&rdquo; said the
white holy one, in a voice hard and stern.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one, O Colum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the Evil One is indeed here.
Cathal, I promised that you would be having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>187]</a></span>
a holy name soon, but that name I will not
be giving you now. You must come to me
in sackcloth and with dust upon your head,
with pain upon you, and with deep grief in
your heart. Then only shall I bless you
before the brothers and call you Cathal Gille-Mhoire,
Cathal the servant of Mary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A bitter, sad waiting it was for him who
had fire in his young blood and was told to
weave frost there, and to put silence upon
the welling song in his heart. But at the
end of the week Cathal was a holy monk
again, and sang the hymns that Colum had
taught him.</p>

<p>It was on the eve of the day when Colum
blessed him before the brethren, and called
him Gille-Muire, that he walked alone, brooding
upon the evil of women and the curse
they brought, and praying to Mary to save
him from the sins of which he scarce knew
the meaning. On his way back to his cell
he passed old Neis, the helot, who said to
him mockingly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a good thing that sorrow, Cathal
mac Art,&mdash;and yet, sure, it is true that but
for the hot love the slain man your father
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>188]</a></span>
had for Foam that was your mother, you
would not be here to praise your God or
serve the woman whom the arch-druid yonder
says is the Mother of God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cathal bade the man eat silence, or it
would go ill with him. But the words
rankled. That night in his cell he woke,
with on his lips his own sinful words:</p>

<div class="cpoem30">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">White hands make better songs than hymns, white hands are young and sweet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O, a sword for me, O Honey-Mouth, and a war-horse fleet!<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On the morrow he went to Colum and
told him that the Evil One would not give
him peace. That night the Saint bade him
make ready to go east to the Isle of Arran&mdash;the
sole isle, then, where the Pictish folk
would let the white robes of the Culdees go
scatheless. To the holy Molios he was to
go, him that dwelled in the sea-cave of the
Isle of the Peak, that men already called the
Holy Isle because of the preaching and the
miracles of Molios.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a wise man,&rdquo; said Colum to himself,
&ldquo;and he was a pagan Cruithne once,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>189]</a></span>
and a prince at that, and he knows the
sweetness of sin, and will keep Cathal away
from the snares that are set. With fasting,
and much peril by day and weariness by
night, the blood of the youth will forget the
songs the Evil One has put into his mind and
it will sing holy hymns. Great will be the
glory. Cathal Gille-Muire will be a holy
man while he has yet his youth upon him;
and he will be a martyr to the flesh by day
and by night and by night and by day, till
the heathen put him to death because of
the faith that is his.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus it was that Cathal was blessed by
Colum, and sent east among the wild Picts.</p>

<p>It was with joy that he served Molios.
For four months he gave him all he had to
give. The old saint passed word to Colum
that Cathal was a saint and was assured of
the crown of martyrdom, and lovingly he
urged that the youth should be sent to the
Isle of Mist in the north, the great isle that
was ruled by Scathach the Queen. There,
at the last Summer-sailing, the pagans had
flayed a monk alive. A fair happy end:
and Cathal was now worthy&mdash;and withal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>190]</a></span>
might triumph, and might even convert the
heathen queen. &ldquo;She is wondrous fair to
see,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;and Cathal is a comely
youth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Colum had answered that the young
monk was to bide where he was, and to seek
to win souls in the pagan Isle of Arran,
where the Cross was still feared.</p>

<p>But with the coming of May and golden
weather, the blood of Cathal grew warm.
At times, even, he dreamed of the Frankish
prince and the evil sweet words he had said.</p>

<p>Then a day of the days came. Molios
and Cathal went to a hill-d&ucirc;n where the Pict
chieftain lived, and converted him and all
the people in the d&ucirc;n and all in the rath
that was beyond the d&ucirc;n. That eve the
daughter of the warrior came upon Cathal
walking in a solitary place, among the green
pines beyond the rath. She was most sweet
to look upon: tall and fair, with eyes like
the sea in a cloudless noon, and hair like
westward wheat turned back upon itself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the name men call you by,
young druid?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am Ardanna,
the daughter of Ecta.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>191]</a></span>
&ldquo;Your beauty is sweet to look upon, Ardanna.
I am Cathal the son of Art the son
of Aodh of the race of Alpein, from the isles
of the sea. But I am not a druid. I am a
priest of Christ, a servant of Mary the Mother
of God, and a son of God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ardanna looked at him. A flush came
into his face. In his eyes the same light
flamed that was there when the Frankish
prince told him of the delights of the
world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it true, O Cathal, that the druids&mdash;that
the priests of Christ and the two other
gods, the white-robed men whom we call
Culdees, and of whom you are one, is it true
that they will have nought to do with
women?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cathal looked upon the woman no more,
but on the ground at his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is true, Ardanna.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl laughed. It was a low, sweet,
mocking laugh, but it went along Cathal&rsquo;s
blood like cloud-fire along the sky. It was
to him as though somewhat he had not seen
was revealed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And is it a true thing that you holy men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>192]</a></span>
look at women askance, and as snares of
peril and evil?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is true, Ardanna; but not so upon
those who are sisters of Christ, and whose
eyes are upon heavenly things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what of those who are not sisters of
your god, and are only women, fair to look
upon, fair to woo, fair to love?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cathal again flushed. His eyes were still
upon the ground. He made no answer.</p>

<p>Ardanna laughed low.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cathal!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, fair daughter of Ecta?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it never longing for love you are?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is but one love for us who have
taken the vows of chastity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is chastity?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cathal raised his eyes and glanced at Ardanna.
Her dark-blue eyes looked at him
pure and sweet, though a smile was upon her
mouth. He sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the sanctity of the body, Ardanna.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not understand,&rdquo; she said simply.
&ldquo;But tell me this, poor Cathal&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you call me poor Cathal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because you have put your manhood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>193]</a></span>
from you&mdash;and you so young, and strong,
and comely&mdash;and are not a warrior, and
care neither for the sword, nor the chase,
nor the harp, nor for women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cathal was troubled. He looked again
and again at Ardanna. The sunset light was
in her yellow hair, which was about her as a
glory. He had seen the moon as wondrous
pale as her beautiful face. Like lilies her
white hands were. He had dreamed of that
flamelight in the eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I care,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>She drew nearer, and leaned a little forward,
and looked at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are good to look upon, Cathal&mdash;the
comeliest youth I have ever seen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The monk flushed. This was the devil-tongue
of which Colum had warned him.
But how sweet the words were: like a harp
that low voice. Sure, sweeter is a waking
dream than a dream in sleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I care,&rdquo; he repeated dully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look, Cathal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slowly he raised his eyes. As his gaze
moved upward it rested on the white breast
which was like sea-foam swelling out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>194]</a></span>
brown sea-weed, for she had a tanned fawn-skin
belted and gold-claspt over the white
robe she wore, and that had disparted for
the warm air to play upon her bosom.</p>

<p>It troubled him. He let his eyes fall
again. The red was on his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cathal!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Ardanna.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you will never put your kiss upon
a woman&rsquo;s lips? Never put your heart upon
a woman&rsquo;s heart? Is it of cold sea water
you are made&mdash;for even the running water
in the streams is warmed by the sun? Tell
me, Cathal, would you leave Molios the
Culdee,&mdash;if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The monk of Christ suddenly flashed his
eyes upon the woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If what, Ardanna?&rdquo; he asked abruptly:
&ldquo;if what, Ardanna that is so witching fair?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I loved you, Cathal? If I, the
daughter of Ecta the chief, loved you, and
took you to be my man, and you took me to
be your woman, would you be content so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stared at her as one in a dream.
Then suddenly all the foolish madness that
had been put upon him by Colum fell away.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>195]</a></span>
What did these old men, Colum and Molios,
know? It is only the young who know what
life is. They were old, and their blood was
gelid.</p>

<p>He put up his arms, as though in prayer.
Then he smiled. Ardanna saw a light in
his eyes that sprang into her heart and sang
a song there that whirled in her ears and
dazzled her eyes and made her feel as though
she had fallen over a great height and were
still falling.</p>

<p>Cathal was no longer pale. A red flame
burned in either cheek. The sunset-light
behind him filled his hair with fire. His
eyes were beacons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cathal, Cathal!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, Ardanna!&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was all. What need to say more.
She was in his arms, and her heart throbbing
against his that leapt in his body like a
wolf fallen in a snare.</p>

<p>He stooped and kissed her. She lifted
her eyes, and his brain swung. She kissed
him, and he kissed her till she gave a
low cry and gently thrust him back. He
laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>196]</a></span>
&ldquo;Why do you laugh, Cathal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I? It is I who laugh now. The old
men put a spell upon me. I am no more
Cathal Gille-Muire, but Cathal mac Art.
Nay, I am Cathal Gille-Ardanna.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that he plucked the branch of a
rowan that grew near. He stripped it of its
leaves, and threw them from him north,
south, east, and west.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you do that, Cathal-<span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">aluinn</span>?&rdquo;
Ardanna asked, looking at him with eyes of
love, and she like a summer morning there,
because of the sunshine in her hair, and the
wild roses on her face, and the hill-tarn blue
of her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These are all the hymns that Colum
taught me. I give them back. I am knowing
them no more. They are idle, foolish
songs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the monk took the branch and broke
it, and threw the pieces upon the ground and
trampled upon them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you that, Cathal-<span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">aluinn</span>?&rdquo; asked
Ardanna, wondering at him with her home-call
eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the branch of all the wisdom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>197]</a></span>
Colum taught me. Old Neis, the helot, was
wise. It is a madness, all that. See, it is
gone: it is beneath my feet: I am a man
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But O Cathal, Cathal! this very day of
the days, Ecta, my father, has become a man
of the Christ-faith, him and his; and he
would do what Molios asked, now. And
Molios would ask your death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Death is a dream.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that Cathal leaned forward and kissed
Ardanna upon the lips twice. &ldquo;A kiss for
life that,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and that a kiss for
death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ardanna laughed a low laugh. &ldquo;The
monk can kiss,&rdquo; she whispered: &ldquo;can the
monk love?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He put his arm about her, and they went
into the dim dark greenness.</p>

<p>The moon rose slowly, a globe of pale
golden fire which spilled unceasingly a yellow
flame upon the suspended billows of the
forest. Star after star emerged. Deep
silence was in the woods, save for the
strange, passionate churring of a night-jar,
where he leaned low from a pine branch and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>198]</a></span>
called to his mate, whose heart throbbed a
flight-away amid the dewy shadows.</p>

<p>The wind was still. The white rays of the
stars wandered over the moveless, over the
shadowless and breathless green lawns of the
tree-tops.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is that sound?&rdquo; said Ardanna, a
dim shape in the darkness, where she lay in
the arms of Cathal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know not,&rdquo; said the youth; for the
fevered blood in his veins sang a song against
his ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cathal listened. He heard nothing. His
eyes dreamed again into the silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is that sound?&rdquo; she whispered
against his heart once again. &ldquo;It is not
from the sea, nor is it of the woods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the moan of Heaven,&rdquo; answered
Cathal wearily: &ldquo;<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">an acain Pharais</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>199]</a></span></p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>They found them there in the twilight of
the dawn. For long, Ecta looked at them
and pondered. Then he glanced at Molios.
There were tears in the heart of the holy
man, but in his eyes a deep anger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bind him,&rdquo; said Ecta.</p>

<p>Cathal woke with the thongs. His gaze
fell upon Molios. He made no sign, and
spake never a word: but he smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What now, O Molios?&rdquo; asked Ecta.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take the woman away. Do with her
as you will&mdash;spare or slay. It matters not.
She is but a woman, and she hath wrought
evil upon this man. To slay were well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is my daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spare, then, if you will; but take her
away. Give her to a man. She shall never
see this renegade again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that, two men led Ardanna away.
She gave a glance at Cathal, who smiled.
No tears were in her eyes: but a proud fire
was there, and she brooked no man&rsquo;s hand
upon her, and walked free.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>200]</a></span>
When she was gone, Molios spake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cathal, that was called Cathal Gille-Muire,
why have you done this thing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I was weary of vain imaginings,
and I am young: and Ardanna is fair, and
we loved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such love is death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So be it, Molios. Such death is sweet
as love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No ordinary death shalt thou have, blasphemer.
Yet even now I would be merciful
if I could. Dost thou call upon God?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I call upon the gods of my fathers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fool, they shall not save you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, I call. I have nought to
do with thy three gods, O Christian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hast thou no fear of hell?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a warrior, and the son of my
father, and of a race of heroes. Why should
I fear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molios brooded a while.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take him,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;and bury
him alive where his gods perchance will hear
his cries and come and save him! Find me
a hollow tree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a great oak near here,&rdquo; said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>201]</a></span>
Ecta, wondering, &ldquo;a great hollow oak whose
belly would hold five men, each standing
upon the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that he led them to an ancient
tree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dost thou repent, Cathal?&rdquo; Molios
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; the young man answered grimly;
&ldquo;I repent. I repent that I wasted the good
days serving you and your three false gods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blaspheme no more. Thou knowest
that these three are one God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cathal laughed mockingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hearken to him, Ecta,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;this
old druid would have you believe that two
men and a woman make one person! Believe
that if you will! As for me, I laugh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But with that, at a sign from Molios, they
lifted and slung him amid the branches of
the oak, and let him slide feet foremost into
the deep hollow heart of the tree.</p>

<p>When the law was done, Molios bade all
near kneel in a circle round the oak. Then
he prayed for the soul of the doomed man.
As he ended this prayer, a laugh flew up
among the high wind-swayed leaves. It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>202]</a></span>
as though an invisible bird were there, mocking
like a jay.</p>

<p>One by one, with bowed heads, Molios
and Ecta and those with him withdrew, all
save two young men who were bidden to
stay. Upon these was bond laid, that they
would not stir from that place for three
days. They were to let none draw nigh;
and no food was to be given to the victim;
and if he cried to them, they were to take
no heed,&mdash;nay, not though he called upon
God or the Mother of God or upon the
White Christ.</p>

<p>All that day there was no sound from the
hollow tree. At the setting of the sun a
blackbird lit upon a small branch that
drooped over the aperture, and sang a brave
lilt. Then the dark came, and the moon
rose, and the stars glimmered through the
dew.</p>

<p>At midnight the moon was overhead. A
flood of pale gold rays lit up the branches of
the oak, and turned the leaves into a lustrous
bronze. The watchers heard a voice singing
in the silence of the night&mdash;a voice muffled
and obscure, as from one in a pit, or as that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>203]</a></span>
of a shepherd straying in a narrow corrie.
Words they caught, though not all; and this
was what they heard:<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Ioua</i> was one of the early Celtic names of the
moon. The allusion (in the fourth line) to the sun,
in the feminine, is in accordance with ancient usage.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>205]</a></span>
The watchers looked at each other, but
said no word. On the pale face of each was
fear and awe. What if this new god-teaching
were false, and if Cathal was right, and the
old gods were the lords of life and death?
The moonlight fell upon them, and they saw
doubt in the eyes of each other. Neither
looked at the white fire. Out of the radiance,
cold eyes might stare upon them: and at
that, sure they would leap to the woods,
laughing wild, and be as the beasts of the
forest.</p>

<p>While it was still dark, an hour before the
dawn, one of the twain awoke from a brief
slumber. His gaze wandered from vague
tree to tree. Thrice he thought he saw dim
shapes glide from bole to bole or from thicket
to thicket. Suddenly he discerned a tall
figure, silent as a shadow, standing at the
verge of the glade.</p>

<p>His low cry aroused his companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, M&ucirc;rta?&rdquo; the young man asked
in a whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When they looked again she was gone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was one of the Hidden People,&rdquo; said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>206]</a></span>
M&ucirc;rta, with restless eyes roaming from dusk
to dusk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are you for knowing that, M&ucirc;rta?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was all in green, just like a green
shadow she was, and I saw the green fire in
her eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you not thought of one that it
might be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ardanna.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that the young man rose and ran
swiftly to the place where he had seen the
figure. But he could see no one. Looking at
the ground he was troubled: for in the moonshine-dew
he descried the imprint of small feet.</p>

<p>Thereafter they saw or heard nought, save
the sights and sounds of the woodland.</p>

<p>At sunrise the two youths rose. M&ucirc;rta
lifted up his arms, then sank upon his knees
with bowed head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you do that forbidden thing?&rdquo;
said Diarmid, that was his companion. &ldquo;Have
you forgotten Cathal the monk that is up there
alone with death? If Molios the holy one
saw you worshipping the Light he would do
unto you as he has done unto Cathal.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>207]</a></span>
But before M&ucirc;rta answered they heard the
voice of Cathal once more&mdash;hoarse and dry
it was, but scarce weaker than when it thrilled
them at the rising of the moon.</p>

<p>This was what he chanted in his muffled
voice out of his grave there in the hollow
oak:</p>

<div class="cpoem30">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O hot yellow fire that streams out of the sky, sword-white and golden,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be a flame upon the monks who are praying in their cells in Ioua!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And be a torch to the men of Lochlin that they discover the Isle and destroy it!<br /></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For I see this thing, that the old gods are the gods that die not:<br /></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And upon this isle of &Acirc;-rinn send sorrow and death and disaster,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">From Molios of the Cave to M&ucirc;rta and Diarmid my doomsmen!<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At that M&ucirc;rta moved close to the oak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hail, O Cathal!&rdquo; he cried. There was
silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Art thou a living man still, or is it the
death of thee that is singing there in the
hollow oak?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My limbs perish, but I die not yet,&rdquo;
answered the muffled voice that had greeted
the sun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am M&ucirc;rta mac M&ucirc;rta mac Neisa, and
my heart is sore for thee, Cathal!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no word to this. A thrush
upon a branch overhead lifted its wings,
sang a wild sweet note, and swooped arrowly
through the green gloom of the
leaves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cathal, that wert a monk, which is the
true thing? Is it Christ, or the gods of our
fathers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silence. Three oaks away a woodpecker
thrust its beak into the soft bark, tap-tapping,
tap-tapping.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>209]</a></span>
&ldquo;Cathal, is it death you are having, there
in the dark and the silence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>M&ucirc;rta strained his ears, but he could hear
no sound. Over the woodlands a voice
floated, drowsy-warm and breast-white&mdash;the
voice of a cuckoo calling a love-note from
cool, green shadow to shadow across a league
of windless blaze.</p>

<p>Then M&ucirc;rta that was a singer, went to
where the bulrushes grew by a little tarn
that was in the moss an arrow-flight away.
He plucked a last-year reed, straight and
brown, and with his knife cut seven holes
in it. With a thinner reed he scooped the
hollow clean.</p>

<p>Thereupon he returned to the oak. Diarmid,
who had begun to eat of the food that
had been left with them, sat still, with his
eyes upon him.</p>

<p>M&ucirc;rta put his hollow reed to his lips, and
he played. It was a forlorn, sweet air that
he had heard from a shepherding woman
upon the hills. Then he played a burying-song
of the islanders, wherein the wash of
the sea and the rippling of the waves upon
the shore was heard. Then he played the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>210]</a></span>
song of love, and the beating of hearts was
heard, and sighs, and a voice like a distant
bird-song rose and fell.</p>

<p>When he ceased, a voice came out of the
hollow oak&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Play me a death-song, M&ucirc;rta mac M&ucirc;rta
mac Neisa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>M&ucirc;rta smiled, and he played again the
song of love.</p>

<p>After that there was silence for a brief
while. Then M&ucirc;rta played upon his reed
for the time it takes a heron to mount her
seventh spiral. Then he ceased, and threw
away the reed, and stood erect, staring into
the greenness. In his eyes was a strange
shine. He sang&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem30">

<span class="i0">Out of the cold grayness of the sea I am hearing, O Cathal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am hearing a wave-muffled voice, as of one who drowns in the depths:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose is that voice? I know it well: it is the voice of the Shadow&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her that is called the Grave, and the song that she sings I know:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>O where is Cathal mac Art, he has warmth for the chill that I have?</i><br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Out of the hot greenness of the wood I am hearing, O Cathal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am hearing a rustling step, as of one stumbling blind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose is that rustling step? I know it well: the rustling walk of the Blind One&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She that is called Silence, and the song that she sings I know:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>O where is Cathal mac Art, that has tears to water my stillness?</i><br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>After that there was silence. M&ucirc;rta moved
away. When he sat by Diarmid and ate,
there was no word spoken. Diarmid did
not look at him, for he had sung a song of
death, and the shadow was upon him. He
kept his gaze upon the moss: if he raised
his eyes might he not see the Slayer, or the
Shadow or the Blind One?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>212]</a></span>
Noon came. None drew nigh: not a
face was seen shadowily afar off. Sometimes
the hoofs of the deer rustled among the
bracken. The snarling of young foxes in an
oak-root hollow was like a red pulse in the
heat. At times, in the sheer abyss of blue
sky to the north, a hawk suspended: in the
white-blaze southerly a blotch like swirled
foam appeared for a moment at long intervals,
as a gannet swung from invisible pinnacles
of air to the invisible sea.</p>

<p>The afternoon drowsed through the sunflood.
The green leaves grew golden, saturated
with light. At sundown a flight of
wild doves rose out of the pines, wheeled
against the shine of the west and flashed out
of sight, flames of purple and rose, of foam-white
and pink.</p>

<p>The gloaming came, silverly. The dew
glistened on the fronds of the ferns, in the
cups of the moss. From glade to glade the
cuckoos called. The stars emerged delicately,
as the eyes of fawns shining through
the greengloom of the forest. Once more
the moon snowed the easter frondage of the
pines and oaks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>213]</a></span>
No one came nigh. Not a sound had
sighed from the oak since M&ucirc;rta had sung at
the goldening of the day. At sunset M&ucirc;rta
had risen, to lean, intent, against the vast
bole. His keen ears caught the jar of a
beetle burrowing beneath the bark. There
was no other sound.</p>

<p>At the fall of dark the watchers heard
the confused far noise of a festival. It waned
as a lost wind. Dim veils of cloud obscured
the moon; a low rainy darkness suspended
over the earth.</p>

<p>Thus went the second day and the second
night.</p>

<p>When, after the weary vigil of the hours,
dawn came at last, M&ucirc;rta rose and struck the
oak with a stone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cathal!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;Cathal!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no sound: not a stir, not a
sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cathal! Cathal!&rdquo;</p>

<p>M&ucirc;rta looked at Diarmid. Then, seeing
his own thought in the eyes of his friend he
returned to his side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Blind One has been here,&rdquo; said
Diarmid in a low voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>214]</a></span>
At noon there was thunder, and great
heat. The noise of rustling wings filled the
underwood.</p>

<p>Diarmid fell into a deep sleep. When the
thunder had travelled into the hills, and a
soft rain fell, M&ucirc;rta climbed into the branches
of the oak. He stared down into the hollow,
but could see nothing save a green dusk that
became brown shadow, and brown shadow
that grew into a blackness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Cathal!</em>&rdquo; he whispered.</p>

<p>Not a breath of sound ascended like
smoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cathal! Cathal!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The slow drip of the rain slipped and
pattered among the leaves. The cry of a
sea-bird flying inland came mournfully across
the woods. A distant clang, as of a stricken
anvil, iterated from the barren mountain
beyond the forest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cathal! Cathal!&rdquo;</p>

<p>M&ucirc;rta broke a straight branch, stripped it
of the leaves, and, forcing the thicker end
downward, let it fall sheer.</p>

<p>It struck with a dull, soft thud. He listened:
there was not a sound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>215]</a></span>
&ldquo;A quiet sleep to you, monk,&rdquo; he whispered,
and slipped down through the boughs,
and was beside Diarmid again.</p>

<p>At dusk the rain ceased. A cool green
freshness came into the air. The stars were
as wind-whirled fruit blown upward from the
tree-tops. The moon, full-orbed and with a
pulse of flame, led a tide of soft light across
the brown shores of the world.</p>

<p>The vigils of the watchers were over. M&ucirc;rta
and Diarmid rose. Without a word they
moved across the glade: the faint rustle of
their feet stirred the bracken: then they left
the under-growth and were among the pines.
Their shadows lapsed into the obscure
wilderness. A doe, heavy with fawn, lay
down among the dewy fern, and was at peace
there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>216]</a></span></p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>At midnight, when the whole isle lay in
the full flood of the moon, Cathal stirred.</p>

<p>For three days and three nights he had
been in that dark hollow, erect, wedged as a
spear imbedded in the jaws of a dead beast.
He had died thrice: with hunger, with thirst,
with weariness. Then when hunger was slain
in its own pain, and thirst perished of its own
agony, and weariness could no more endure,
he stirred with the death-throe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I die,&rdquo; he moaned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Die not, O white one,&rdquo; came a floating
whisper, he knew not whence, though it was
to him as though the crushing walls of oak
breathed the sound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I die,&rdquo; he gasped, and the froth bubbled
upon his nether lip. With that his last
strength went. No more could he hold his
head above his shoulder, nor would his feet
sustain him. Like a stricken deer he sank.
So thin was he, so worn, that he slipt into a
narrow crevice where dead leaves had been,
and lay there, drowning in the dark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>217]</a></span>
Was that death, or a cold air about his
feet, he wondered? With a dull pain he
moved them: they came against no tree-wood&mdash;the
coolness about them was of
dewy moss. A wild hope flashed into his
mind. With feeble hands he strove to sink
farther into the crevice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I die,&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;I die now, at the
last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Die not, O white one,&rdquo; breathed the
same low sweet whisper, like leaves stirred by
a nesting bird.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Save, O save,&rdquo; muttered the monk,
hoarse with the death-dew.</p>

<p>Then a blackness came down upon him
from a great height, and he swung in that
blank gulf as a feather swirled this way and
that in the void of an abyss.</p>

<p>When the darkness lifted again, Cathal was
on his back, and breathing slow, but without
pain. A sweet wonderful coolness and ease,
that he knew now! Where was he? he
wondered. Was he in that P&agrave;ras that Colum
and Molios had spoken of? Was he in Hy
Br&agrave;sil, of which he had heard Aodh the
Harper sing? Was he in Tir-na&rsquo;n-&Ograve;g, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>218]</a></span>
all men and women are young for evermore,
and there is joy in the heart and peace in
the mind and delight by day and by night?</p>

<p>Why was his mouth so cool, that had
burned dry as ash? Why were his lips
moist, with a bitter-sweet flavour, as though
the juice of fruit was there still?</p>

<p>He pondered, with closed eyes. At last
he opened them, and stared upward. The
profound black-blue dome of the sky held
group after group of stars that he knew: was
not that sword and belt yonder the sword-gear
of Fionn? Yon shimmering cluster, were
they not the dust of the feet of Alldai? That
leaping green and blue planet, what could it
be but the harp of <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Brigidh</span>, where she sang
to the gods?</p>

<p>A shadow crossed his vision. The next
moment a cool hand was upon his eyes. It
brought rest, and healing. He felt the
blood move in his veins: his heart beat: a
throbbing was in his throat.</p>

<p>Then he knew that he had strength to
rise. With a great effort he put his weariness
from off him, and staggered to his
feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>219]</a></span>
Cathal gave a low sob. A fair beautiful
woman stood by him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ardanna!&rdquo; he cried, though even as the
word leaped from his lips he knew that he
looked upon no Pictish woman.</p>

<p>She smiled. All his heart was glad because
of that. The light in her eyes was
like the fire of the moon, bright and wonderful.
The delicate body of her was pale
green, and luminous as a leaf, with soft
earth-brown hair falling down her shoulders
and over the swelling breast; even as the
small green mounds over the dead the two
breasts were. She was clad only in her own
loveliness, though the moonshine was about
her as a garment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like a green leaf, like a green leaf,&rdquo; Cathal
muttered over and over below his breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you a dream?&rdquo; he asked simply,
having no words for his wonder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Cathal, I am no dream. I am a
woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A woman? But ... but ... you have
no body as other women have: and I see
the moonbeam that is on your breast shining
upon the moss behind you!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>220]</a></span>
&ldquo;Is it thinking you are, poor Cathal, that
there are no women and no men in the
world except those who are in thick flesh,
and move about in the suntide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cathal stared wonderingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am of the green people, Cathal. We
are of the woods. I am a woman of the
woods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hast thou a name, fair woman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am called De&ograve;in.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a>
<i>Deo-uaine.</i></p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;That is well. Truly &lsquo;Green Life&rsquo; is a
good name for thee. Are there others of
thy kin in this place?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; and at that she stooped, lifted
the dew of a white flower in the moonshine,
and put it upon his eyes.</p>

<p>Cathal looked about him. Everywhere he
saw tall fair pale-green lives moving to and
fro: some passing out of trees, swift and
silent as rain out of a cloud; some passing
into trees, silent and swift as shadows. All
were fair to look upon: tall, lithe, graceful,
moving this way and that in the moonshine,
pale green as the leaves of the lime, soft
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>221]</a></span>
shining, with radiant eyes, and delicate
earth-brown hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are these, De&ograve;in?&rdquo; Cathal asked
in a low whisper of awe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are my people: the folk of the
woods: the green people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they come out of trees: they come
and they go like bees in and out of a hive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trees? That is your name for us of the
woods. <em>We</em> are the trees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>You</em> the trees, De&ograve;in! How can that
be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is life in your body. Where does
it go when the body sleeps, or when the sap
rises no more to heart or brain, and there is
chill in the blood, and it is like frozen water?
Is there a life in your body?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, so. I know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The flesh is <em>your</em> body: the tree is <em>my</em>
body.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you are the green life of a tree?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am the green life of a tree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And these?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are as I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see those that are men and those that
are women, and their offspring too I see.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>222]</a></span>
&ldquo;They are as I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And some are crowned with pale flowers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And hast thou no crown, De&ograve;in, who art
so fair?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither hast thou, Cathal, though thy face
is fair. Thy body I cannot see, because thou
hast a husk about thee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a low laugh Cathal removed his
raiment from him. The whiteness of his
body was like a flower there in the moonshine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That shall not be against me,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Truly I am a man no longer, if thee and
thine will have me as one of the wood-folk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that De&ograve;in called. Many green phantoms
glided out of the trees, and others, hand-in-hand,
flower-crowned, crossed the glade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look, green lives,&rdquo; De&ograve;in cried in her
sweet leaf-whisper, rising now like a wind-song
among birchen boughs: &ldquo;Look, here is
a human. His life is mine, for I saved him.
I have put the moonshine dew upon his eyes.
He sees as we see. He would be one of us,
for all that he has no tree for his body, but
flesh, white over red.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>223]</a></span>
One who had moved thitherward out of an
ancient oak looked at Cathal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wouldst thou be of the wood-folk, man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, fain am I; for sure, for sure, O druid
of the trees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wilt thou learn and abide by our laws,
the first of which is that none may stir from
his tree until the dusk has come, nor linger
away from it when the dawn opens gray lips
and drinks up the shadows?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no law now but the law of green
life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good. Thou shalt live with us. Thy
home shall be the hollow oak where thy kin
left thee to die. Why did they do that evil
deed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I did not believe in the new
gods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are thy gods, man whom this green
one here calls Cathal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are the Sun, and the Moon, and
the Wind, and others that I will tell you of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hast thou heard of Keithoir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is the god of the green world. He
dreams, and his dreams are Springtide and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>224]</a></span>
Summertide and Appletide. When he sleeps
without dream there is winter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you no other god but this earth-god?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keithoir is our god. We know no
other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he is thy god, he is my god.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see in the eyes of De&ograve;in that she loves
thee, Cathal the human. Wilt thou have
her love?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cathal looked at the girl. His heart
swam in light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, if De&ograve;in will give me her love, my
love shall be hers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Annir-Choille moved forward, and
brushed softly against him as a green branch.</p>

<p>He put his arms around her. She had a
cool, sweet body to feel. He was glad she
was no moonshine phantom. The beating
of her heart against his made a music that
filled his ears.</p>

<p>De&ograve;in stooped and plucked white, dewy
flowers. Of these she wove a wreath for
Cathal. He, likewise, plucked the white
blooms, and made a coronal of foam for the
brown wave of her hair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>225]</a></span>
Then, hand in hand, they fared slowly
forth across the moonlit glade. None crossed
their path, though everywhere delicate green
lives flitted from tree to tree. They heard
a wonderful sweet singing, aerial, with a
ripple as of leaves lipping a windy shore of
light. A green glamour was in the eyes of
Cathal. The green fire of life flamed in his
veins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>226]</a></span></p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Molios, the saint of Christ, that lived in
the sea-cave of the Isle of the Peak, so that
even in his own day it was called the Holy
Isle, endured to a great age.</p>

<p>Some say of him that before his hair was
bleached white as the bog-cotton, he was
slain by the heathen Picts, or by the fierce
summer-sailors out of Lochlin. But that is
an idle tale. His end was not thus. A
Culdee, who had the soul of a bat, feared
the truth, though that gave glory to God,
and wrote both in ogham and lambskin the
truthless tale that Molios went forth with the
cross and was slain in a north isle.</p>

<p>On a day of the days every year, Molios
fared to the Hollow Oak that was in the hill-forest
beyond the rath of Ecta mac Ecta.
There he spake long upon the youth that
had been his friend, and upon how the Evil
One had prevailed with Cathal, and how the
islander had been done to death there in
the oak. Then he and all his company sang
the hymns of peace, and great joy there was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>227]</a></span>
over the doom of Cathal the monk, and
many would have cleft the great tree or
burned it, so that the dust of the sinner
might be scattered to the four winds: only
this was banned by Molios.</p>

<p>It was well for Cathal, who slept there
through the hours of light! Deep slumber
was his, for never once did he hear the
noontide voices, nor ever in his ears was the
long rise and fall of the holy hymns.</p>

<p>But when, in the twentieth year after
Cathal had been thrust into the hollow oak,
Molios came at sundown, being weary with
the heat, the saint heard a low, faint laughter
issuing from the tree, like fragrance from a
flower.</p>

<p>None other heard it. He saw that with
gladness. Quietly he went with the islanders.</p>

<p>When the moon was over the pines, and
all in the rath slept, Molios arose and went
silently back into the forest.</p>

<p>When he came to the Doom-Tree he
listened long, with his ear against the bark.
There was no sound.</p>

<p>His voice was old and quavering, but fresh
and young in the courts of heaven, when it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>228]</a></span>
reached there like a fluttering bird tired from
long flight. He sang a holy hymn.</p>

<p>He listened. There was no laughter. He
was glad at that. All had been a dream, for
sure.</p>

<p>Then it was that he heard once again the
low, mocking laughter. He started back,
trembling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cathal!&rdquo; he cried, with his voice like a
wuthering wind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am here, O Molios,&rdquo; said a voice
behind him.</p>

<p>The old Culdee turned, as though arrow-nipped.
Before him, white in the moonshine,
stood a man, naked.</p>

<p>At first Molios knew him not. He was so
tall and strong, so fair and wonderful. Long
locks of ruddy hair hung upon his white
shoulders: his eyes were lustrous, and had
the lovely, soft light of the deer. When he
moved, it was swiftly and silently. No stag
upon the hills was more fair to see.</p>

<p>Then, slowly, Cathal the monk swam into
Cathal of the Woods. Molios saw him
whom he knew of old, as a blue flame is
visible within the flame of yellow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>229]</a></span>
&ldquo;I am here, O Molios.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Strange was the voice: faint and far the
tone of it: yet it was that of a living man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it a spirit you are, Cathal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am no spirit. I am Cathal the monk
that was, Cathal the man now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How came you out of hell, you that are
dead, and the dust of whose crumbling bones
is in the hollow of this oak?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no hell, Culdee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No hell!&rdquo; Molios the Saint stared at
the wood-man in blank amaze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No hell!&rdquo; he said again; &ldquo;and is there
no heaven?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A hell there is, and a heaven there is:
but not what Colum taught, and you taught.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doth Christ live?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Mary?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And God the Father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a lie that you have upon your lips.
Sure, Cathal, you shall be dead indeed soon,
to the glory of God. For I shall have thy
dust scattered to the four winds, and thy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>230]</a></span>
bones consumed in flame, and a stake be
driven through the place where thou wast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once more Cathal laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go back to the sea-cave, Molios. Thou
hast much to learn. Brood there upon the
ways of thy God before thou judgest if He
knoweth no more than thou dost. And see,
I will show you a wonder. Only, first, tell
me this one thing. What of Ardanna whom
I loved?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was accursed. She would not believe.
When Ecta took the child from her, that was
born in sin, to have the water put upon it
with the sign of the Cross, she went north
beyond the Hill of the Pinnacles. There she
saw the young king of the Picts of Argyll,
and he loved her, and she went to his d&ucirc;n.
He took her to his rath in the north, and she
was his queen. He, and she, and the two
sons she bore to him are all under the hill-moss
now: and their souls are in hell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cathal laughed, low and mocking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a good hell that, I am thinking,
Molios. But come ... I will show you a
wonder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that he stooped, and took the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>231]</a></span>
moonshine dew out of a white flower, and put it
upon the eyes of the old man.</p>

<p>Then Molios saw.</p>

<p>And what he saw was a strangeness and
a terror to him. For everywhere were green
lives, fair and comely, gentle-eyed, lovely, of
a soft shining. From tree to tree they flitted,
or passed to and fro from the tree-boles, as
wild bees from their hives.</p>

<p>Beside Cathal stood a woman. Beautiful
she was, with eyes like stars in the gloaming.
All of green flame she seemed, though the
old monk saw her breast rise and fall, and
the light lift of her earth-brown hair by a
wind-breath eddying there, and the hand
of her clasped in that of Cathal. Beyond
her were fair and beautiful beings, lovely
shapes like unto men and women, but soulless,
though loving life and hating death,
which, of a truth, is all that the vain human
clan does.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is this woman, Cathal?&rdquo; asked the
saint, trembling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is De&ograve;in, whom I love, and who has
given me life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And these ... that are neither green
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>232]</a></span>
phantoms out of trees, nor yet men as we
are?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These are the offspring of our love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molios drew back in horror.</p>

<p>But Cathal threw up his arms, and with
glad eyes cried:</p>

<div class="cpoem25">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;O green flame of life, pulse of the world.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Love! O Youth! O Dream of Dreams.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;O bitter grief,&rdquo; Molios cried, &ldquo;O bitter
grief, that I did not slay thee utterly on that
day of the days! Flame to thy flesh, and a
stake through thy belly&mdash;that is the doom
thou shouldst have had! My ban upon thee,
Cathal, that was a monk, and now art a wild
man of the woods: upon thee, and thy
Annir-Coille, and all thy brood, I put the
ban of fear and dread and sorrow, a curse
by day and a curse by night!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But with that a great dizziness swam into
the brain of the saint, and he fell forward,
and lay his length upon the moss, and there
was no sight to his eyes, or hearing to his
ears, or knowledge upon him at all until the
rising of the sun.</p>

<p>When the yellow light was upon his face
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>233]</a></span>
he rose. There was no face to see anywhere.
Looking in the dew for the myriad feet that
had been there, he saw none.</p>

<p>The old man knelt and prayed.</p>

<p>At the first praying God filled his heart
with peace. At the second praying God
filled his heart with wonder. At the third
praying God whispered mysteriously, and he
knew. Humble in his new knowledge, he
rose. The tears were in his old eyes. He
went up to the Hollow Oak, and blessed it,
and the wild man that slept within it, and the
Annir-Coille that Cathal loved, and the offspring
of their love. He took the curse away,
and he blessed all that God had made.</p>

<p>All the long weary way to the shore he
went as one in a dream. Wonder and mystery
were in his eyes.</p>

<p>At the shore he entered the little coracle
that brought him daily from the Holy Isle, a
triple arrow-flight seaward.</p>

<p>A child sat in it, playing with pebbles. It
was Ardan, the son of Ardanna.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ardan mac Cathal,&rdquo; began the saint,
weary now, but glad with a strange new
gladness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>234]</a></span>
&ldquo;Who is Cathal?&rdquo; said the boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He that was thy father. Tell me, Ardan,
hast thou ever seen aught moving in the
woods&mdash;green lives out of the trees?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have seen a green shine come out of
the trees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Molios bowed his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou shalt be as my son, Ardan; and
when thou art a man thou shalt choose thy
own way, and let no man hinder thee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That night Molios could not sleep. Hearing
the loud wash of the sea, he went to the
mouth of the cave. For a long while he
watched the seals splashing in the silver
radiance of the moonshine. Then he called
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O seals of the sea, come hither!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that all the furred swimmers drew
near.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it for the curse you give us every year
of the years, O holy Molios?&rdquo; moaned a
great black seal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">R&ograve;n dubh</span>, it is no curse I have for
thee or thine, but a blessing, and peace. I
have learned a wonder of God, because of
an Annir-Coille in the forest that is upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>235]</a></span>
hill. But now I will be telling you the white
story of Christ.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So there, in the moonshine, with the flowing
tide stealing from his feet to his knees,
the old saint preached the gospel of love.
The seals crouched upon the rocks, with their
great brown eyes filled with glad tears.</p>

<p>When Molios ceased, each slipped again
into the shadowy sea. All that night, while
he brooded upon the mystery of Cathal and
the Annir-Coille, with deep knowledge of
hidden things, and a heart filled with the
wonder and mystery of the world, he heard
them splashing to and fro in the moon-dazzle,
and calling, one to the other, &ldquo;We,
too, are the sons of God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At dawn a shadow came into the cave. A
white frost grew upon the face of Molios.
Still was he, and cold, when Ardan, the child,
awoke. Only the white lips moved. A ray
of the sun slanted across the sea, from the
great disc of whirling golden flame new
risen. It fell softly upon the moving lips.
They were still then, and Ardan kissed them
because of the smile that was there.</p>

<br />
<span class="smlfont">THE SIGHT<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></span></h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> These four short episodes are reprinted, by
courteous consent of the Editor of <i>Harper&rsquo;s Magazine</i>,
where they appeared, interpolated in &ldquo;From
the Hebrid Isles.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE &ldquo;vision,&rdquo; or second-sight, is more
common in the Western Isles than in
the Highlands; now at least, when all things
sacred to the Celtic race, from the ancient
language to the degenerate and indeed all
but vanished Beltane and Samh&rsquo;in rites, are
smiled at by the gentle and mocked by the
vulgar. A day will come when men will
lament more what is irrecoverable than ever
a nation mourned for lapsed dominion. It
is a bitter cruel thing that strangers must rule
the hearts and brains, as well as the poor
fortunes, of the mountaineers and islanders.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>240]</a></span>
Yet in doing their best to thrust Celtic life
and speech and thought into the sea, they
are working a sore hurt for themselves that
they shall discern in the day of adversity.
We of the passing race know this thing: that
in a day to come the sheep-runs shall not be
in the Isles and the Highlands only&mdash;for we
see the forests moving south, and there will
be lack, then, not of deer and of sheep, but
of hunters and shepherds.</p>

<p>That which follows is only a memento of
what was told me last summer by a fisherman
of Iona. If I were to write all I have heard
about what is called second-sight, it would
be a volume and not a few pages I should
want. The &ldquo;sight&rdquo; has been a reality to
me almost from the cradle, for my Highland
nurse had the faculty, and I have the memory
of more than one of her trances.</p>

<p>There is an old man on the island named
<span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Daibhidh</span> (David) Macarthur.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> It was Ivor
McLean, my boatman friend, who took me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>241]</a></span>
to him. He is a fine old man, though
&ldquo;heavy&rdquo; a little; with years, perhaps, for
his head is white as the crest of a wave.
He is one of the very few of Iona, perhaps
of the two or three at most, who do not
speak any English.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a>
As there are several Macarthurs on Iona, I may
say that the old man I allude to was not so named.
Out of courtesy I disguise his name: though, since
the above was written, he is no more.</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he told me, &ldquo;he had never had
the sight himself. Ivor was wrong in saying
that he had.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This, I imagine, was shyness, or, rather,
that innate reticence of the Celt in all profoundly
intimate and spiritual matters; for,
from what Ivor told me, I am convinced
that old Macarthur had more than once
proved himself a seer.</p>

<p>But he admitted that his wife had
&ldquo;it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We were seated on an old upturned boat
on the rocky little promontory, where once
were first laid the innumerable dead, brought
for burial to the sacred soil of Iona. For a
time Macarthur spoke slowly about this and
that; then, abruptly and without preamble,
he told me this:</p>

<p>The Christmas before last, Mary, his wife,
had seen a man who was not on the island.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>242]</a></span>
&ldquo;And that is true, by St. Martin&rsquo;s Cross,&rdquo;
he added.</p>

<p>They were, he said, sitting before the fire,
when, after a long silence, he looked up to see
his wife staring into the shadow in the ingle.
He thought she was brooding over the barren
womb that had been her life-long sorrow,
and now in her old age had become a
strange and gnawing grief, and so he turned
his gaze upon the red coals again.</p>

<p>But suddenly she exclaimed, &ldquo;<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">C&rsquo;ait am
bheil thu dol?</i>&rdquo; (Where are you going?)</p>

<p>He looked up, but saw no one in the
room beside themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has come to you?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;What do you see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she took no notice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">C&rsquo;uine tha thu falbh?</i>&rdquo; (When are
you going?) she muttered, with the same
strained voice and frozen eyes. And then,
once again, &ldquo;<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">C&rsquo;uine thig thu rithisd?</i>&rdquo;
(When will you come again?) And with
that she bowed her head, and the thin backs
of the hands upon her knees were wet with
falling tears.</p>

<p>For the fourth of an hour thereafter she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>243]</a></span>
would say nothing except moan, &ldquo;<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Tha an
amhuinn domhain; tha an amhuinn domhain;
fuar, fuar; domhain, domhain!</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
(Deep, deep is the river; cold and deep;
cold and deep!)</p>

</div>

<p>And the man she saw, added Macarthur,
was her nephew, Luthais, in Cape Breton, of
Nova Scotia, who, as they learned before
Easter, was drowned that Christmas-tide.
He was the last of his mother&rsquo;s race, and
had been the foster-child of Mary.</p>

<h3>II<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">THE DARK HOUR OF FERGUS</span></h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N September of last year I was ferried
across the Sound of Kerrera by an old
boatman.</p>

<p>That afternoon I went with my friend, a
peasant farmer near the south end of Kerrera,
and lay down in the grassy, bouldered wilderness
beneath the cliff on which stands the
ruin of Gylen Castle. The tide called in a
loud insistent whisper, rising to a hoarse
gurgle, from the Sound. The breeze that
came from the mountains of Mull was honey-sweet
with heather smell. The bleating of
the ewes and lambs, the screaming of a few
gulls,&mdash;nothing else was audible. At times,
it is true, like a deep sigh, the suspiration of
the open sea rose and fell among the islands.
Faint echoes of that sigh came round Gylen
headland and up the Kyle. It was an hour
wherein to dream of the sons of Morven, who
had landed here often, long before the ancient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>245]</a></span>
stronghold was built; of Fionn and the
F&eacute;inn of the coming and going of Ossian in
his blind old age; of beautiful Malvina; of
the galleys of the Fomorians; of the songs
and the singers and all the beautiful things
of &ldquo;the old ancient long ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the tale that I heard from my friend
was this:</p>



<p class="break">You know that my mother&rsquo;s people are
Skye folk. It was from the mother of my
mother that I heard what you call the Incantation
of the Spirit, though I never heard it
called anything but old Elsie&rsquo;s <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Sian</i>. She
lived near the Hart o&rsquo; Corry. You know the
part? Ay, true, it is wild land&mdash;wild even
for the wilderness o&rsquo; Skye. Old mother Elsie
had &ldquo;the sight&rdquo; at times, and whenever she
wished she could find out the lines o&rsquo; life.
It was magic, they say. Who am I to
know? This is true, she knew much that no
one else knew. When my mother&rsquo;s cousin,
Fergus MacEwan, who was mate of a sloop
that sailed between Stornoway and Ardrossan,
came to see her&mdash;and that was in the year
before my mother was married, and when she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>246]</a></span>
was courted by Fergus, though she was never
for giving her life to him, for even then she
loved my father, poor fisherman of Ulva
though he was (though heir, through his
father&rsquo;s brother, to his crofter-farm on
Kerrera here)&mdash;when Fergus came to see
her, because of the gloom that was upon his
spirit, she foretold all. At first she could
&ldquo;see&rdquo; poorly. But one wild afternoon, when
the Cuchullins were black with cloud-smoke,
she bade him meet her in that lonely savage
glen they call the Loat o&rsquo; Corry. He was
loath to go, for he feared the place. But he
went. He told all to my mother before he
went away next dawn, with the heart in him
broken, and his hope as dead as a herring in
a net.</p>

<p>Mother Elsie came to him out of the dusk
in that wuthering place just like a drifting
mist, as he said. She gave him no greeting,
but was by his side in silence. Before he knew
what she was doing she had the soles of her
feet upon his, and her hands folding his, and
her eyes burning against his like hot coals
against ash. He felt shudders come over
him, and a wind blew up and down his back;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>247]</a></span>
and he grew giddy, and heard the roaring of
the tides in his ears. Then he was quiet.
Her voice was very far away when she said
this thing, but he remembered every word
of it:</p>

<div class="cpoem30">

<span class="i0"><i>Oh! oh! <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">ohrone, ochrone</span>! green the branches bonnie:</i><br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>Oh! oh! <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">mo ghraidh</span>.</i><br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then it was that a great calm came
upon Fergus, though he felt like a drowned
man, or as one who stood by his own body,
but speechless, and feeling no blowing of
wind through his shadow-frame.</p>

<p>For, indeed, though the body lived, he
was already of the company of the silent.
What was that <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">caiodh</i>, that wailing lamentation,
sad as the <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Cumha fir Arais</i>, which
followed Elsie&rsquo;s incantation, her spell upon
&ldquo;the way&rdquo; before him, that it and all the
trailed lines of this life should be clear as
moonlight before her? <em>Oh! oh! <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">ohrone,
ochrone</span>! red the blood-drop berries</em>; did not
these mean no fruit of the quicken-tree, but
the falling drops from the maimed tree that
was himself? And was not the green-clad
lady, she who comes singing low, the sprouting
of the green grass that is the hair of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>249]</a></span>
earth? And was not the road, gleaming wet
with ruts and pools all of tears, and overhung
by dark rustling plumes of sorrow, the
road that the soul traverses in the dark hour?
And did not all this mean that the Grave
Spell was already upon him, and that the
Silence was to be his?<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a>
(1) <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Caiodh</i> (a wailing lament) is a difficult word
to pronounce. The Irish <i>keen</i> will help the foreigner
with <i>K&uacute;&euml;-yh</i> or <i>K&uacute;&euml;-yhn</i>. (2) The <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Cumha fir
Arais</i> (pronounce <i>K&#365;v&rsquo;ah feer Arooss</i>) means the
lament of the man of Aros&mdash;<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, the chieftain.
Aros Castle, on the great island of Mull, overlooking
the Sound, was one of the strongholds of
Macdonald, Lord of the Isles. (3) The quicken
(rowan, mountain-ash, and other names) is a sacred
tree with the Celtic peoples, and its branches can
either avert or compel supernatural influences. (4)
The green-clad Lady is the Cailleach, the Siren of the
Hill-Sides, to see whom portends death or disaster.
When she is heard singing, that portends death
soon for the hearer. The grass is that which grows
quick and green above the dead. The dark hour is
the hour of death&mdash;<i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, the first hour after death.</p>
</div>

<p>But what thing it was she saw, Elsie
would not say. Darkly she dreamed awhile,
then leaned forward and kissed his breast.
He felt the sob in her heart throb into his.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>250]</a></span>
Dazed, and knowing that she had seen
more than she had dreamed of seeing, and
that his hour was striding over the rocky
wilderness of that wild Isle of Skye, he did
not know she was gone, till a shuddering fear
of the silence and the gloom told him he
was alone.</p>



<p class="break">Coll MacColl (he that was my Kerrera
friend) stopped here, just as a breeze will
suddenly stop in a corrie so that the rowan
berries on the side of a quicken will sway
this way and that, while the long thin leaves
on the other will be as still as the stones
underneath, where their shadows sleep.</p>

<p>I asked him at last if Elsie&rsquo;s second-sight
had proved true. He looked at me for a
moment, as though vaguely surprised I should
ask so foolish a thing.</p>



<p class="break">No sleep came to Fergus that night,
he resumed, quietly, as though no other
words were needed, and at daybreak he
rose and left the cot of his kinsman, Andrew
MacEwan. In the gray dawn he saw
my mother, and told her all. Then she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>251]</a></span>
wished him farewell, and bade him come
again when next the <i>Sunbeam</i> should be
sailing to Portree, or other port in Skye;
for she did not believe that her mother had
seen speedy death, or death at all, but
perhaps only a time of sorrow, and even that
she had done this thing to send Fergus away,
for she too had her eyes on Robert MacColl,
that was my father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so you will come again, Fergus
my friend,&rdquo; she said; and added, &ldquo;and perhaps
then you will be telling me of a Sunbeam
ashore, as well as that you sail from
Ardrossan to the far away islands!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stared at her as one who hears ill.
Then he took her hand in his, and let it go
suddenly again. With one arm he rubbed
the rough Uist cap he held in his left hand;
then he brushed off the wet mist that was
gray on his thick black beard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not well, Fearghas-<span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">mo-charaid</span>,&rdquo;
my mother said, and gently. When
she saw the staring pain in his eyes, she
added, with a low sob, &ldquo;My heart is sore for
you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that he turned away, and she saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>252]</a></span>
him no more, that day or any day of all the
days to come.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what thing happened, Coll?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They kept it from her, and she did
not know it for long. It was this: Fergus
McEwan did not sail far that morning. He
was ill, he said, and was put ashore. That
night Aulay Macaulay saw him moving about
in that frightful place of the Storr Rock,
moaning and muttering. He would have
spoken to him, but he saw him begin to leap
about the pinnacled rocks like a goat, and
at last run up to The Old Man of Storr and
beat it with his clinched fists, blaspheming with
wild words; and he feared Fergus was mad,
and he slipped from shadow to shadow, till
he fled openly. But in the morning Aulay
and his brother Finlay went back to look for
Fergus. At first they thought he had been
drowned, or had fallen into one of the fissures.
But from a <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">balachan</i>, a &lsquo;bit laddie,&rsquo; as
they would call him in the town over the way
[Oban], they heard that a man had pushed
off that morning in John Macpherson&rsquo;s boat,
that lay about a mile and a half from the
Storr, and had sailed north along the coast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>253]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well, it was three days before he was
found&mdash;stone-dead. If you know the Quiraing
you will know the great Needle Rock.
Only a bird can climb it, as the saying goes.
Half-way up, Finlay Macaulay and a man of
the neighbourhood saw the body o&rsquo; Fergus as
though it were glued to the rock. It was
windless weather, for he would have blown
away like a drifted leaf. They had to jerk
the body down with net-poles. God save us
the dark hour of Fergus, that died like a
wild beast!&rdquo;</p>

<br />
<span class="smlfont">THE WHITE FEVER</span></h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NE night, before the peats, I was told
this thing by old Cairstine Macdonald,
in the isle of Benbecula. It is in her
words that I give it:</p>



<p class="break">In the spring of the year that my boy
Tormaid died, the moon-daisies were as thick
as a woven shroud over the place where
Giorsal, the daughter of Ian, the son of Ian
MacLeod of <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Baille &rsquo;n Bad-a-sgailich</span>, slept
night and day.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Baille &rsquo;n Bad-a-sgailich</i>: the Farm of the Shadowy
Clump of Trees. <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Cairstine</i>, or <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Cairistine</i>, is
the Gaelic for <i>Christian</i>, as <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Tormaid</i> is for Norman,
and <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Giorsal</i> for Grace. &ldquo;The quiet havens&rdquo; is the
beautiful island phrase for graves. Here, also, a
swift and fatal consumption that falls upon the
doomed is called &ldquo;The White Fever.&rdquo; By &ldquo;the
mainland,&rdquo; Harris and Lewis are meant.</p>
</div>

<p>All that March the cormorants screamed,
famished. There were few fish in the sea,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>255]</a></span>
and no kelp-weed was washed up by the
high tides. In the island and in the near
isles, ay, and far north through the mainland,
the blight lay. Many sickened. I
knew young mothers who had no milk.
There are green mounds in Carnan kirk-yard
that will be telling you of what this
meant. Here and there are little green
mounds, each so small that you might cuddle
it in your arm under your plaid.</p>

<p>Tormaid sickened. A bad day was that
for him when he came home, weary with
the sea, and drenched to the skin, because
of a gale that caught him and his mates off
Barra Head. When the March winds tore
down the Minch, and leaped out from over
the Cuchullins, and came west, and lay
against our homes, where the peats were
sodden and there was little food, the minister
told me that my lad would be in the quiet
havens before long. This was because of
the white fever. It was of that same that
Giorsal waned, and went out like a thin flame
in sunlight.</p>

<p>The son of my man (years ago weary no
more) said little ever. He ate nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>256]</a></span>
almost, even of the next to nothing we
had. At nights he couldna sleep because
of the cough. The coming of May lifted
him awhile. I hoped he would see the
autumn; and that if he did, and the herring
came, and the harvest was had, and what wi&rsquo;
this and what wi&rsquo; that, he would forget his
Giorsal that lay i&rsquo; the mools in the quiet
place yonder. Maybe then, I thought, the
sorrow would go, and take its shadow with it.</p>

<p>One gloaming he came in with all the
whiteness of his wasted body in his face.
His heart was out of its shell; and mine,
too, at the sight of him.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">A cochall a&rsquo; chridhe</i>: his heart out of its shell&mdash;a
phrase often used to express sudden derangement
from any shock. The ensuing phrase means the
month from the 15th of July to the 15th of August,
<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Mios crochaidh nan con</i>, so called as it is supposed
to be the hottest if not the most waterless month in
the isles. The word <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">claar</i> used below, is the name
given a small wooden tub, into which the potatoes
are turned when boiled.</p>
</div>

<p>This was in the season of the hanging of
the dog&rsquo;s mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, Tormaid-<span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">a-ghaolach</span>?&rdquo; I
asked, with the sob that was in my throat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Thraisg mo chridhe</i>,&rdquo; he muttered (my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>257]</a></span>
heart is parched). Then, feeling the asking
in my eyes, he said, &ldquo;I have seen her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I knew he meant Giorsal. My heart sank.
But I wore my nails into the palms of my
hands. Then I said this thing, that is an
old saying in the isles: &ldquo;Those who are in
the quiet havens hear neither the wind nor
the sea.&rdquo; He was so weak he could not lie
down in the bed. He was in the big chair
before the peats, with his feet on a <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">claar</i>.</p>

<p>When the wind was still I read him the
Word. A little warm milk was all he would
take. I could hear the blood in his lungs
sobbing like the ebb-tide in the sea-weed.
This was the thing that he said to me:</p>

<p>&ldquo;She came to me, like a gray mist, beyond
the dyke of the green place, near the road.
The face of her was gray as a gray dawn, but
the voice was hers, though I heard it under a
wave, so dull and far was it. And these are
her words to me, and mine to her&mdash;and
the first speaking was mine, for the silence
wore me:</p>

<h3>IV<br />
<br />
<span class="smlfont">THE SMOOTHING OF THE HAND</span></h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">G</span>LAD am I that wherever and whenever
I listen intently I can hear the looms
of Nature weaving Beauty and Music. But
some of the most beautiful things are learned
otherwise&mdash;by hazard, in the Way of Pain,
or at the Gate of Sorrow.</p>

<p>I learned two things on the day when I
saw Sheumas McIan dead upon the heather.
He of whom I speak was the son of Ian
McIan Alltnalee, but was known throughout
the home straths and the countries beyond
as Sheumas Dhu, Black James, or, to render
the subtler meaning implied in this instance,
James the Dark One. I had wondered occasionally
at the designation, because Sheumas,
if not exactly fair, was not dark. But
the name was given to him, as I learned
later, because, as commonly rumoured, he
knew that which he should not have known.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>261]</a></span>
I had been spending some weeks with
Alasdair McIan and his wife Silis (who was
my foster-sister), at their farm of Ardoch,
high in a remote hill country. One night
we were sitting before the peats, listening to
the wind crying amid the corries, though,
ominously as it seemed to us, there was not
a breath in the rowan-tree that grew in the
sun&rsquo;s-way by the house. Silis had been
singing, but silence had come upon us. In
the warm glow from the fire we saw each
others&rsquo; faces. There the silence lay, strangely
still and beautiful, as snow in moonlight.
Silis&rsquo;s song was one of the <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Dana Spioradail</i>,
known in Gaelic as the Hymn of the Looms.
I cannot recall it, nor have I ever heard or
in any way encountered it again.</p>

<p>It had a lovely refrain, I know not whether
its own or added by Silis. I have heard her
chant it to other runes and songs. Now,
when too late, my regret is deep that I did
not take from her lips more of those sorrowful
strange songs or chants, with their ancient
Celtic melodies, so full of haunting sweet
melancholy, which she loved so well. It
was with this refrain that, after a long stillness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>262]</a></span>
she startled us that October night. I
remember the sudden light in the eyes of
Alasdair McIan, and the beat at my heart,
when, like rain in a wood, her voice fell
unawares upon us out of the silence:</p>

<div class="cpoem30">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Oh! oh! ohrone, arone! Oh! Oh! mo ghraidh, mo chridhe!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Oh! oh! mo ghraidh, mo chridhe!</i><a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a><br /></span>
</div>

</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a>
Pronounce mogh-r&#257;y, mogh-r&#275;e (my heart&rsquo;s delight&mdash;<i>lit.</i>,
my dear one, my heart).</p>
</div>

<p>The wail, and the sudden break in the
second line, had always upon me an effect
of inexpressible pathos. Often that sad
wind-song has been in my ears, when I
have been thinking of many things that are
passed and are passing.</p>

<p>I know not what made Silis so abruptly
begin to sing, and with that wailing couplet
only, or why she lapsed at once into silence
again. Indeed, my remembrance of the
incident at all is due to the circumstance
that shortly after Silis had turned her face
to the peats again, a knock came to the
door, and then Sheumas Dhu entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you sing that lament, Silis, sister
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>263]</a></span>
of my father?&rdquo; he asked, after he had seated
himself beside me, and spread his thin hands
against the peat glow, so that the flame
seemed to enter within the flesh.</p>

<p>Silis turned to her nephew, and looked at
him, as I thought, questioningly. But she
did not speak. He, too, said nothing more,
either forgetful of his question, or content
with what he had learned or failed to learn
through her silence.</p>

<p>The wind had come down from the corries
before Sheumas rose to go. He said he
was not returning to Alltnalee, but was going
upon the hill, for a big herd of deer had
come over the ridge of Mel-M&ograve;r. Sheumas,
though skilled in all hill and forest craft, was
not a sure shot, as was his kinsman and my
host, Alasdair McIan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will need help,&rdquo; I remember Alasdair
Ardoch saying, mockingly, adding, &ldquo;<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Co
dhiubh is fhearr let mise thoir sealladh na
f&agrave;ileadh dhiubh?</i>&rdquo;&mdash;that is to say, Whether
would you rather me to deprive them of
sight or smell?</p>

<p>This is a familiar saying among the old
sportsmen in my country, where it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>264]</a></span>
believed that a few favoured individuals have
the power to deprive deer of either sight
or smell, as the occasion suggests.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Dhuit ci&agrave;r nan carn!</i>&mdash;The gloom of
the rocks be upon you!&rdquo; replied Sheumas,
sullenly; &ldquo;mayhap the hour is come when
the red stag will sniff at my nostrils.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that dark saying he went. None of
us saw him again alive.</p>

<p>Was it a forewarning? I have often wondered.
Or had he sight of the shadow?</p>

<p>It was three days after this, and shortly
after sunrise, that, on crossing the south
slope of Mel M&ograve;r with Alasdair Ardoch, we
came suddenly upon the body of Sheumas,
half submerged in a purple billow of heather.
It did not, at the moment, occur to me that
he was dead. I had not known that his
prolonged absence had been noted, or that
he had been searched for. As a matter of
fact, he must have died immediately before
our approach, for his limbs were still loose,
and he lay as a sleeper lies.</p>

<p>Alasdair kneeled and raised his kinsman&rsquo;s
head. When it lay upon the purple
tussock, the warmth and glow from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>265]</a></span>
sunlit ling gave a fugitive deceptive light to
the pale face. I know not whether the sun
can have any chemic action upon the dead.
But it seemed to me that a dream rose to
the face of Sheumas, like one of those submarine
flowers that are said to rise at times
and be visible for a moment in the hollow of
a wave. The dream, the light, waned; and
there was a great stillness and white peace
where the trouble had been. &ldquo;It is the
Smoothing of the Hand,&rdquo; said Alasdair
McIan, in a hushed voice.</p>

<p>Often I had heard this lovely phrase in
the Western Isles, but always as applied
to sleep. When a fretful child suddenly
falls into quietude and deep slumber, an
isles-woman will say that it is because of
the Smoothing of the Hand. It is always
a profound sleep, and there are some who
hold it almost as a sacred thing, and never
to be disturbed.</p>

<p>So, thinking only of this, I whispered to
my friend to come away; that Sheumas was
dead weary with hunting upon the hills; that
he would awake in due time.</p>

<p>McIan looked at me, hesitated, and said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>266]</a></span>
nothing. I saw him glance around. A few
yards away, beside a great boulder in the
heather, a small rowan stood, flickering its
featherlike shadows across the white wool of
a ewe resting underneath. He moved
thitherward slowly, plucked a branch heavy
with scarlet berries, and then, having returned,
laid it across the breast of his kinsman.</p>

<p>I knew now what was that passing of the
trouble in the face of Sheumas Dhu, what
that sudden light was, that calming of the
sea, that ineffable quietude. It was the
Smoothing of the Hand.</p>

<h2>THE SONG OF THE SWORD</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HESE are of the Seanachas told me by
Ian Cameron (&ldquo;Ian M&ograve;r&rdquo;), before
the flaming peats, at a hill-shealing, in a
season when the premature snows found the
bracken still golden and the ptarmigan with
their autumn browns no more than flecked
and mottled with gray.</p>

<p>He has himself now a quieter sleep than
the sound of that falling snow, and it is
three years since his face became as white
and as cold.</p>

<p>He had pleasure in telling <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">sgeul</i> after
<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">sgeul</i> of the ancient days. Far more readily
at all times would he repeat stories of this
dim past he loved so well than the more
intimate tales which had his own pulse beating
in them, as &ldquo;The Daughter of the Sun&rdquo;
and others that I have given elsewhere.
Often he would look up from where he held
his face in his hands as he brooded into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>272]</a></span>
dull steadfast flame that consumed the core
of the peats; and without preamble, and with
words in no apparent way linked to those
last spoken, would narrate some brief episode,
and always as one who had witnessed
the event. Sometimes, indeed, these brief
tales were like waves: one saw them rise,
congregate, and expand in a dark billow&mdash;and
the next moment there was a vanishing
puff of spray and the billow had lapsed.</p>

<p>I cannot recall many of these fugitive
tales&mdash;<span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">seanachas</span>, as he spoke of them collectively,
for each <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">sgeul</i> was of the past, and
had its roots in legendary lore&mdash;but of
those that remained with me, here are four.
All came upon me as birds flying in the
dark: I knew not whence they came or
upon what wind they had steered their mysterious
course. They were there, that was
all. Ancient things come again in Ian&rsquo;s
brain: or recovered out of the dim days,
and seen anew through the wonder-lens of
his imagination.</p>



<p class="break"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>273]</a></span>
It was in a white June, as they call it, in the
third year after the pirates of Lochlin had
fed the corbies of the Hebrid Isles, that the
summer-sailors once more came down the
Minch of Skye.</p>

<p>An east wind blew fresh from the mountains,
though between dawn and sunrise it
veered till it chilled itself upon the granite
peaks of the Cuchullins, and then leaped
north-westward with the white foam of its
feet caught from behind by the sun-glint.</p>

<p>The vikings on board the <i>Svart-Alf</i> laughed
at that. The spray flew from the curved
black prow of the great galley, and the wake
danced in the dazzle&mdash;the sea-cream that
they loved to see.</p>

<p>Tall men they were, and comely. Their
locks of yellow or golden or ruddy hair,
sometimes braided, sometimes all acurl like a
chestnut-tree bud-breaking in April, sometimes
tangled like sea-wrack caught in a
whirl of wind and tide, streamed upon their
shoulders. In their blue eyes was a shining
as though there were torches of white flame
behind them: and that shining was mild or
fierce as home or blood filled their brain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>274]</a></span>
The <i>Svart-Alf</i> was the storm-bird of a
fleet of thirty galleys which had set forth
from Lochlin under the raven-banner of
Olaus the White. The vikings had joyed in
a good faring. Singing south winds had
blown them to the Faroe Isles, where from
Magnus Cleft-Hand they had good cheer,
and the hire of three men who knew the
Western Isles and had been with the sea-kings
who had harried them here and there
again and again.</p>

<p>From Magnus-stead they went forth
swelled with mead and ale and cow-beef:
and they laughed because of what they would
give in payment on their way back with
golden torques and bracelets and other treasure,
young slaves, women dark and fair, and
the jewel-hilted weapons of the island-lords.</p>

<p>Cold black winds out of the north-east
drove them straight upon the Ord of Sutherland.
They sang with joy the noon when
they rounded Cape Wrath and came under
the shadow of the hills. The dawn that
followed was red not only in the sky but on
the sheen of the sword-blades. It was the
Song of the Sword that day, and there is no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>275]</a></span>
song like that for the flaming of the blood.
The dark men of Torridon were caught
unawares. For seven days thereafter the
corbies and ravens glutted themselves drinking
at red pools beside the stripped bodies
which lay stark and stiff upon the heather.
The firing of a score of homesteads smouldered
till the rains came, a day and two
nights after the old women who had been
driven to the moors stole back wailing. The
maids and wives were carried off in the
galleys: and for nine days, at a haven in the
lone coast opposite the Summer Isles, their
tears, their laughter, their sullen anger, their
wild gaiety, their passionate despair gave
joy to the yellow-haired men. On the ninth
day they were carried southward on the
summer-sailing. At a place called Craig-Feeach,
Raven&rsquo;s Crag, in the north of Skye,
where a Norse Erl had a great D&ucirc;n that he
had taken from the son of a king from
Eir&egrave;ann whose sea-nest it had been, Olaus
the White rested awhile. The women were
left there as a free spoil: save three who
were so fair that Olaus kept one, and Haco
and Sweno his chief captains took the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>276]</a></span>
Then, on an evening when the wind was
from the north, Olaus and ten galleys went
down the sound. Sweno the Hammerer was
to strike across the west for the great island
that is called Lewis: Haco the Laugher
was to steer for the island that is called
Harris: and Olaus himself was to reach the
haven called Ljotr-wick in the Isle of the
Thousand Waters that is Benbecula.</p>

<p>On the eve of the day following that sailing
a wild wind sprang up, blowing straight
against the north. All of the south-faring
galleys save one made for haven, though it
was a savage coast which lay along the south
of Skye. In the darkness of the storm
Olaus thought that the other nine wave-steeds
were following him, and he drove before
the gale, with his men crouching under
the lee of the bulwarks, and with Finnleikr
the Harper singing a wild song of sea-foam
and flowing blood and the whirling of swords.</p>

<p>The gale was nigh spent three hours after
dawn: but the green seas were like snow-crowned
hillocks that roll in earth-drunkenness
when the flames surge from blazing
mountains. Olaus knew that no boat could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>277]</a></span>
live in that sea, except it went before the
wind. So, though not a galley was in sight,
he fared steadily westward.</p>

<p>By sundown the wind had swung out of
the south into the east: and by midnight the
stars were shining clear. In the blue-dark
could be seen the white wings of the fulmars,
seaward-drifting once again from the rocks
whither they had fled.</p>

<p>Then came the dawn when the sun-rain
streamed gladly, and a fresh east wind blew
across the Minch, and the <i>Svart-Alf</i>, that
had been driven far northward, came leaping
south-westwardly, with laughter and fierce
shining of sky-blue eyes, where the vikings
toiled at the oars, or burnished their brine-stained
swords and javelins.</p>

<p>All day they fared joyously thus. Behind
them they could see the blue line of the
mainland and the dark-blue mountain-crests
of Skye: southward was a long green film,
where Coll caught the waves ere they drove
upon Tiree; south-eastward, the gray-blue
peaks of Halival and Haskival rose out of
the Isle of Terror, as R&ugrave;m was then called.
Before them, as far as they could see to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>278]</a></span>
north or south, the purple-gray lines that
rose out of the west were the contours of
the Hebrides.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dost thou see yonder blue splatch,
Morna?&rdquo; cried Olaus the White to the
woman who lay indolently by his side, and
watched the sun-gold redden the mass of
ruddy hair which she had sprayed upon the
boards, a net wherein to mesh the eyes of
the vikings, &ldquo;do you see that blue splatch?
I know what it is. It is the headland that
Olaf the Furious called Skipness. Behind it
is a long fjord in two forks. At the end of
the south fork is a place of the white-robes
whom the islanders call Culdees. Midway
on the eastern bend of the north fork is a
town of a hundred families. Over both
rules Maoliosa, a warrior-priest, and under
him, at the town, is a graybeard called
Rumun mac Coag. All this I have learned
from Anlaf the Swarthy, who came with us
out of Faroe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morna glanced at him under her drooped
eyelids. Sure, he was fair to see, for all that
his long hair was white. White it had gone
with the terror of a night on an ice-floe,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>279]</a></span>
whereon a man who hated the young erl had
set him adrift with seven wolves. He had
slain three, and drowned three, and one had
leaped into the sea: and then he had lain on
the ice, with snow for a pillow, and in the dawn
his hair was the same as the snow. This was
but ten years ago, when he was a youth.</p>

<p>She looked at him, and when she spoke it
was in the slow lazy speech that in his ears
was drowsy-sweet as the hum of the hives in
the steading where his home was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be a red sleep the men of that
town will be having soon, I am thinking,
Olaus. And the women will not be carding
wool when the moon rises to-morrow night.
And ...&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fair woman stopped suddenly. Olaus
saw her eyes darken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Olaus!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I listen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If there is a woman there that you desire
more than me I will give her a gift.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olaus laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep your knife in your girdle Morna.
Who knows but you may need it soon to
save yourself from a Culdee!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>280]</a></span>
&ldquo;Bah. These white-robed men-women
have nought to do with us. I fear no man,
Olaus: but I have a blade for the woman
who will dazzle your eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have no fear, white wolf. The sea-wolf
knows his mate when he has found
her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>An hour after sun-setting a mist came up.
The wind freshened. Olaus made silence
throughout the war-galley. The vikings had
muffled their oars, for the noise of the waves
on the shore could now be heard. Hour after
hour went by. When, at last, the moonlight
tore a rift in the h&auml;ar, and suddenly the
vapour was licked up by a wind moving out
of the north, they saw that they were close
upon the land, and right eastward of the
headland of Skipness.</p>

<p>Anlaf the Swarthy went to the prow.
Blackly he loomed in the moonlight as he
stood there, poising his long spear, and
sounding the depths while the vessel slowly
forged shoreward. By the time a haven was
found, and the vikings stood silent upon the
rocks, the night was yellow with moonshine,
and the brown earth overlaid with a soft
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>281]</a></span>
white sheen wherein the long shadows lay
palely blue.</p>

<p>There was deep peace in the island-town.
The kye were in the sea-pastures near, and
even the dogs slept. There had been no
ill for long, and Rumun mac Coag was an
old man, and dreamed overmuch about his
soul. This was because of the teaching of
the Culdees. Before he had known he had
a soul he was a man, and would not have
been taken unawares&mdash;and he over-lord of a
sea-town like <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Bail&rsquo;-tiorail</span>.</p>

<p>Olaus the White made a wide circuit with
his men. Then, slowly, the circle narrowed.</p>

<p>A bull lowed, where it stood among the
sea-grass, stamping uneasily, and ever and
again sniffing the air. Suddenly one heifer,
then another, then all the kye, began a
strange lowing. The dogs rose, with bristling
felts, and crawled sidelong, snarling,
with red eyes gleaming savagely.</p>

<p>Bethoc, the young third wife of Rumun, was
awake, dreaming of a man out of Eir&egrave;ann
who had that day given her a strange pleasure
with his harp and his dusky eyes. She
knew that lowing. It was the <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">langanaich an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>282]</a></span>
aghaidh am allamharach</i>, the continued
lowing against the stranger. She rose
lightly, and unfastened the leather flap, and
looked down from the <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">grianan</span> where she
was. A man stood there in the shadow.
She thought it was the harper. With a low
sigh she leaned downward to kiss him, and
to whisper a word in his ear.</p>

<p>Her long hair fell over her eyes and face
and blinded her. She felt it grasped, and
put out her hand. It was seized, and before
she knew what was come upon her she was
dragged prone upon the man.</p>

<p>Then, in a flash, she saw he had yellow
hair, and was clad as a Norseman. She
gasped. If the sea-rovers were come, it was
death for all there. The man whispered something
in a tongue that was strange to her.
She understood better when he put his arm
about her, and placed a hand upon her mouth.</p>

<p>Bethoc stood silent. Why did no one
hear that lowing of the kine, that snarling
of the dogs which had now grown into a
loud continuous baying? The man by her
side thought she was cowed, or had accepted
the change of fate. He left her, and put
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>283]</a></span>
his foot in a cleft. Then, sword under his
chin, he began to climb stealthily.</p>

<p>He had thrown his spear upon the ground.
Soundlessly Bethoc stepped forward, lifted it,
and moved forward like a shadow.</p>

<p>A wild cry rang through the night. There
was a gurgling and spurting sound as of
dammed water adrip. Rumun sprang from
his couch, and stared out of the aperture.
Beneath he saw a man, speared through the
back, and pinned to the soft wood. His
hands claspt the frayed deer-skins, and his
head lay upon his shoulder. He was laughing
horribly. A bubbling of foam frothed
continuously out of his mouth.</p>

<p>The next moment Rumun saw Bethoc.
He had not time to call to her before a man
slipped out of the shadow, and plunged a
sword through her till the point dripped red
drops upon the grass beyond where she
stood. She gave no cry, but fell as a gannet
falls. A black shadow darted across the
gloom. A crash, a scream, and Rumun
sank inert, with an arrow fixed midway in his
head through the brows.</p>

<p>Then there was a fierce tumult everywhere.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>284]</a></span>
From the pastures the kye ran lowing and
bellowing, in a wild stampede. The neighing
of horses broke into screams. Here and
there red flames burst forth, and leapt from
hut to hut. Soon the whole rath was aflame.
Round the d&ucirc;n of Rumun a wall of swords
flashed.</p>

<p>All had taken refuge in the d&ucirc;n, all who
had escaped the first slaying. If any leaped
forth, it was upon a viking spear, or if the
face of any was seen it was the targe for a
swift-sure arrow.</p>

<p>A long penetrating wail went up. The
Culdees, on the further loch, heard it, and
ran from their cells. The loud laughter of
the sea-rovers was more dreadful to them
than the whirling flames and the wild screaming
lament of the dying and the doomed.</p>

<p>None came forth alive out of that d&ucirc;n,
save three men, and seven women that were
young. Two of the men were made to tell
all that Olaus the White wanted to know.
Then they were blinded, and put in a boat,
and set in the tide-eddy that would take
them to where the Culdees were. And, for
the Culdees, they had a message from Olaus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>285]</a></span>
Of the seven women none was so fair that
Morna had any heed. But seven men had
them as spoil. Their wild keening had died
away into a silence of blank despair long
before the dawn. When the light came, they
were huddled in a white group near the
ashes of their homes. Everywhere the dead
sprawled.</p>

<p>At sunrise the vikings held an ale-feast.
When Olaus the White had drunken and
eaten, he left his men and went down to the
shore to look upon the fortified place where
Maoliosa the Culdee and his white-robes
lived. As he fared thither through what had
been <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Bail&rsquo;-tiorail</span> there was not a male left
alive save the one prisoner who had been
kept, Aongas the Bow-maker as he was
called: none save Aongas, and a strayed
child among the salt grasses near the shore,
a little boy, naked and with blue eyes and
laughing sunny smile.</p>

<h2>THE FLIGHT OF THE CULDEES</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>N the wane of noon, on the day following
the ruin of <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Bail&rsquo;-tiorail</span>, sails were
descried far east of Skipness.</p>

<p>Olaus called his men together. The boats
coming before the wind were doubtless his
own galleys which he had lost sight of when
the south-gale had blown them against Skye:
but no man can know when and how the
gods may smile grimly, and let the swords
that whirl be broken or the spears that are
flat become a hedge of death.</p>

<p>An hour later, a startled word went from
viking to viking. The galleys in the offing
were the fleet of Sweno the Hammerer.
Why had he come so far southward, and
why were oars so swift and with the stained
sails distended before the wind?</p>

<p>They were soon to know.</p>

<p>Sweno himself was the first to land. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>290]</a></span>
man he was, broad and burly, with a sword-slash
across his face that brought his brows
together in a frown which made a perpetual
dusk above his savage blood-shot eyes.</p>

<p>In a few words he told how he had met a
galley, with only half its crew, and of these
many who were wounded. It was the last
of the fleet of Haco the Laugher. A fleet
of fifteen war-birlinns had set out from the
Long Island, and had given battle. Haco
had gone into the strife laughing loud as was
his wont, and he and all his men had the
berserk rage, and fought with joy and foam
at the mouth. Never had the Sword sang a
sweeter song.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Olaus the White, grimly,
&ldquo;well: how did the Raven fly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When Haco laughed for the last time,
with waving sword out of the death wherein
he sank, there was only one galley left. Of
all that company of vikings there were no
more than nine to tell the tale. These nine
we took out of their boat, which was below
waves soon. Haco and his men are all fighting
the sea-shadows by now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A loud snarling went from man to man.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>291]</a></span>
This became a wild cry of rage. Then savage
shouts filled the air. Swords were lifted
up against the sky, and the fierce glitter of
the blue eyes and the bristling of the tawny
beards were fair to see, thought the captive
women, though their hearts beat against their
ribs like eaglets against the bars of a cage.</p>

<p>Sweno the Hammerer frowned a deep
frown when he heard that Olaus was there
with only the <i>Svart-Alf</i> out of the galleys
which had gone the southward way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the islanders come upon us now with
their birlinns we shall have to make a running
fight,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Olaus laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye, but the running shall be after the
birlinns, Sweno.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hear that there are fifty and nine men,
of these Culdees yonder, under the sword-priest
Maoliosa?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a true word. But to-night, after
the moon is up, there shall be none.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that, all who heard laughed, and were
less heavy in their hearts because of the
slaying and drowning of Haco the Laugher
and all his crew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>292]</a></span>
&ldquo;Where is the woman Brenda that you
took?&rdquo; Olaus asked, as he stared at Sweno&rsquo;s
boat and saw no woman there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is in the sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Olaus the White looked. It was his eyes
that asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I flung her into the sea because she
laughed when she heard of how the birlinns
that were under Somhairle the Renegade
drave in upon our ships and how Haco
laughed no more, and the sea was red with
Lochlin blood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was a woman, Sweno&mdash;and none more
fair in the isles, after Morna that is mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Woman or no woman I flung her into
the sea. The Gael call us <i>Gall</i>: then I will
let no Gael laugh at the Gall. It is enough.
She is drowned. There are always women:
one here, one there&mdash;it is but a wave blown
this way or that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this moment a viking came running
across the ruined town with tidings. Maoliosa
and his Culdees were crowding into a
great birlinn. Perhaps they were coming to
give battle: mayhap they were for sailing
away from that place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>293]</a></span>
Olaus and Sweno stared across the fjord.
At first they knew not what to think. If
Maoliosa thought of battle he would scarce
choose that hour and place. Or was it that
he knew the Gael were coming in force,
and that the vikings were caught in a
trap?</p>

<p>At last it was clear. Sweno gave a great
laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the blood of Odin,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;they
come to sue for peace!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slowly across the loch the birlinn, filled
with white-robed Culdees, drew near. At
the prow stood a tall old man, with streaming
hair and beard, white as sea-foam. In his
right hand he grasped a great Cross, whereon
was Christ crucified.</p>

<p>The vikings drew close one to the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hail them in their own tongue, Sweno,&rdquo;
said Olaus.</p>

<p>The Hammerer moved to the water-edge,
as the birlinn stopped, a short arrow-flight
away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho, there, priests of the Christ-faith!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would you, viking?&rdquo; It was
Maoliosa himself that spoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>294]</a></span>
&ldquo;Why do you come here among us, you
that are Maoliosa?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To win you and yours to God, pagan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it madness that is upon you, old man?
We have swords and spears here, if we lack
hymns and prayers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All this time Olaus kept a wary watch
inland and seaward, for he feared that
Maoliosa came because of an ambush.</p>

<p>Truly the old monk was mad. He had
told his Culdees that God would prevail, and
that the pagans would melt away before the
Cross.</p>

<p>The ebb-tide was running swift. Even
while Sweno spoke, the birlinn touched a
low sea-hidden ledge of rock.</p>

<p>A cry of consternation went up from the
white-robes. Loud laughter came from the
vikings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arrows!&rdquo; cried Olaus.</p>

<p>With that three score men took their
bows. There was a hail of death-shafts.
Many fell into the water, but some were in
the brains and hearts of the Culdees.</p>

<p>Maoliosa himself stood in death, transfixed
to the mast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>295]</a></span>
With a wild cry the monks swept their
oars backward. Then they leaped to their
feet and changed their place, and rowed for
life or death.</p>

<p>The summer-sailors sprang into their galley.
Sweno the Hammerer was at the bow.
The foam curled and hissed.</p>

<p>The birlinn grided upon the opposite
shore at the selfsame moment when Sweno
brought down his battle-axe upon the monk
who steered. The man was cleft to the
shoulder. Sweno swayed with the blow,
stumbled, and fell headlong into the sea.
A Culdee thrust at him with an oar, and
pinned him among the sea-tangle. Thus
died Sweno the Hammerer.</p>

<p>Then all the white-robes leaped upon the
shore. Yet Olaus was quicker than they.
With a score of vikings he raced to the
Church of the Cells, and gained the sanctuary.
The monks uttered a cry of despair, and,
turning, fled across the moor. Olaus counted
them. There were now forty in all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let forty men follow,&rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p>Like white birds, the monks fled this way
and that. Olaus and those who watched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>296]</a></span>
laughed at them as they stumbled because
of their robes. One by one fell, sword-cleft
or spear-thrust. The moorland was
red.</p>

<p>At the last there were less than a score&mdash;twelve
only&mdash;ten!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring them back!&rdquo; Olaus shouted.</p>

<p>When the ten fugitives were captured and
brought back, Olaus took the crucifix that
Maoliosa had raised, and held it before each
in turn. &ldquo;Smite,&rdquo; he said to the first monk.
But the man would not. &ldquo;Smite!&rdquo; he said
to the second: but he would not. And so
it was to the tenth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Olaus the White: &ldquo;they
shall witness to their god.&rdquo; With that he
bade his vikings break up the birlinn, and
drive the planks into the ground, and shore
them up with logs.</p>

<p>When this was done he crucified each
Culdee. With nails and with ropes he did
unto each what their god had suffered.
Then all were left there, by the water-side.</p>

<p>That night, when Olaus the White and
the laughing Morna left the great bonfire
where the vikings sang and drank horn after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>297]</a></span>
horn of strong ale, they stood and looked
across the loch. In the moonlight, upon
the dim verge of the further shore, they
could discern ten crosses. On each was a
motionless white splatch.</p>

<h2>MIRCATH</h2>

<p class="center">The <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Mire Chath</i> was the name given to the war-frenzy
that often preceded and accompanied battle.</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN Haco the Laugher saw the
islanders coming out of the west in
their birlinns, he called to his vikings:
&ldquo;Now of a truth we shall hear the Song of
the Sword!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ten galleys of the Summer-Sailors
spread out into two lines of five boats, each
boat an arrow-flight from those on either
side.</p>

<p>The birlinns came on against the noon.
In the sun-dazzle they loomed black as a
shoal of pollack. There were fifteen in all,
and from the largest, midway among them,
flew a banner. On this banner was a disc
of gold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the Banner of the Sunbeam,&rdquo;
shouted Olaf the Red, who with Torquil the
One-Armed was hero-man to Haco. &ldquo;I
know it well. The Gael who fight under
that are warriors indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>302]</a></span>
&ldquo;Is there a saga-man here?&rdquo; cried Haco.
At that a great shout went up from the
vikings: &ldquo;Harald the Smith!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A man rose among the bow-men in Olaf&rsquo;s
boat. It was Harald. He took a small
square harp, and he struck the strings. This
was the song he sang:</p>

<div class="cpoem22">

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A shiver passed over every viking. Strong
men shook as a child when lightning plays.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>303]</a></span>
Then the trembling passed. The mircath,
the war-frenzy, came on them. Loud
laughter, went from boat to boat. Many
tossed the great oars, and swung them down
upon the sea, splashing the sun-dazzle into
a yeast of foam. Others sprang up and
whirled their javelins on high, catching them
with bloody mouths: others made sword-play,
and stammered thick words through a
surf of froth upon their lips. Olaf the Red
towered high on the steering-plank of the
<i>Calling Raven</i>, swirling round and round a
mighty battle-axe: on the <i>Sea-Wolf</i>, Torquil
One-Arm shaded his eyes, and screamed
hoarsely wild words that no one knew the
meaning of. Only Haco was still for a time.
Then he, too, knew the mircath: and he
stood up in the <i>Red-Dragon</i> and laughed
loud and long. And when Haco the Laugher
laughed, there was ever blood and to spare.</p>

<p>The birlinns of the islanders drave on
apace. They swayed out into a curve, a
black crescent there in the gold-sprent blue
meads of the sea. From the great birlinn
that carried the Sunbeam came a chanting
voice:</p>

<div class="cpoem30">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>304]</a></span>
<span class="i0">O &rsquo;tis a good song the sea makes when blood is on the wave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a good song the wave makes when its crest o&rsquo; foam is red!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the rovers out of Lochlin the sea is a good grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the bards will sing to-night to the sea-moan of the dead!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yo-ho-a-h&rsquo;eily-a-yo, eily, ayah, a yo!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sword and Spear and Battle-axe sing the Song of Woe.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Ayah, eily, a yo!<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Eily, ayah, a yo!<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then there was a swirling and dashing of
foam. Clouds of spray filled the air from
the thresh of the oars.</p>

<p>No man knew aught of the last moments
ere the birlinns bore down upon the viking-galleys.
Crash and roar and scream: and a
wild surging: the slashing of swords, the
whistle of arrows, the fierce hiss of whirled
spears, the rending crash of battle-axe and
splintering of the javelins, wild cries, oaths,
screams, shouts of victors and yells of the
dying, shrill taunts from the spillers of life
and savage choking cries from those drowning
in the bloody yeast, that bubbled and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>305]</a></span>
foamed in the maelstrom where the war-boats
swung and reeled this way and that&mdash;and
over all the loud death-music of Haco
the Laugher.</p>

<p>Olaf the Red went into the sea, red
indeed, for the blood streamed from head
and shoulders and fell about him as a scarlet
robe. Torquil One-Arm fought, blind and
arrow-sprent, till a spear went through his
neck, and he sank among the dead. Louder
and louder grew the fierce shouts of the
Gael: fewer the savage screaming cries of
the vikings. Thus it was till two galleys
only held living men. The <i>Calling Raven</i>
turned and fled, with the nine men who
were not wounded to the death. But on the
<i>Red Dragon</i> Haco the Laugher still laughed.
Seven men were about him. These fought
in silence.</p>

<p>Then Toscar mac Aonghas that was leader
of the Gael took his bow. None was arrow-better
than Toscar of the Nine Battles. He
laid down his sword and took his bow, and
an arrow went through the right eye of Haco
the Laugher. He laughed no more. The
seven died in silence. Swaran Swift-foot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>306]</a></span>
was the last. When he fell he wiped away
the blood that streamed over his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Skoal!</i>&rdquo; he cried to the hero of the
Gael, and with that he whirled his battle-axe
at Toscar mac Aonghas: and the soul of
Toscar met his, in the dark mist, and upon
the ears of both fell at one and the same
time the glad laughter of the gods in
Valhalla.</p>

<h2>THE LAUGHTER OF SCATHACH THE QUEEN</h2>

<p class="center"><i><span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Scathach</span> (pronounced Sc&aacute;-ya or Sk&yacute;-ya) was an
Amazonian queen of the Isle of Skye, and is supposed
to have given her name to that island.</i></p>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N the year when Cuchullin left the Isle of
Skye, where Scathach the warrior-Queen
ruled with the shadow of death in the palm
of her sword-hand, there was sorrow because
of his beauty. He had fared back to Eir&eacute;,
at the summons of Concobar mac Nessa,
Ard-Righ of Ulster. For the Clan of the
Red Branch was wading in blood, and there
were seers who beheld that bitter tide rising
and spreading.</p>

<p>Cuchullin was only a youth in years: but
he had come to Skye a boy, and he had left
it a man. None fairer had ever been seen
of Scathach or of any woman. He was tall
and lithe as a young pine: his skin was as
white as a woman&rsquo;s breast: his eyes were of
a fierce bright blue, with a white light in
them as of the sun. When bent, and with
arrow half-way drawn, he stood on the
heather, listening against the belling of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>310]</a></span>
deer; or when he leaned against a tree,
dreaming not of eagle-chase or wolf-hunt, but
of the woman whom he had never met; or
when, by the d&ucirc;n, he played at sword-whirl
or spear-thrust, or raced the war-chariot across
the machar&mdash;then, and ever, there were eyes
upon his beauty and there were some who
held him to be Angus Ogue himself. For
there was a light about him, such as the hills
have in the sun-glow an hour before set. His
hair was the hair of Angus and of the fair
gods: earth-brown shot with gold next his
head, ruddy as flame midway, and, where it
sprayed into a golden mist of fire, yellow
as windy sunshine.</p>

<p>But Cuchullin loved no woman upon Skye,
and none dared openly to love Cuchullin, for
Scathach&rsquo;s heart yearned for him, and to
cross the Queen was to put the shroud upon
oneself. Scathach kept an open face for
the son of Lerg. There was no dark frown
above the storm in her eyes when she looked
at his sunbright face. Gladly she slew a
woman because Cuchullin had lightly reproved
the maid for some idle thing: and
once, when the youth had looked in grave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>311]</a></span>
silence at three viking-captives whom she
had spared because of their comely manhood,
she put her sword through the heart
of each, and sent him the blade, dripping
red, as the flower of love.</p>

<p>But Cuchullin was a dreamer, and he
loved what he dreamed of, and that woman
was not Scathach, nor any of her warrior-women
who made the Isle of Mist a place of
terror for those cast upon the wild shores, or
stranded there in the ebb of inglorious battle.</p>

<p>Scathach brooded deep upon her vain
desire. Once, in a windless shadowy gloaming,
she asked him if he loved any woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Et&aacute;in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her breath came quick and hard. It was
for pleasure to her then to think of Cuchullin
lying white at her feet, with the red blood
spilling from the whiteness of his breast.
But she bit her underlip, and said quietly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is Et&aacute;in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is the wife of M&iacute;dir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with that the youth turned and moved
haughtily away. She did not know that the
Et&aacute;in of whom Cuchullin dreamed was no
woman that he had seen in Eir&eacute;, but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>312]</a></span>
wife of M&iacute;dir the King of Faerie, who was so
passing fair that Mac Greine, the beautiful
god, had made for her a <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">grianan</span> all of shining
glass, where still she lives in a dream,
and in that sun-bower still is fed at dawn
upon the bloom of flowers and at dusk upon
their fragrance. <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">O ogham mhic Gr&eacute;ine, tha
e boidheach</i>,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> she sighs for ever in her sleep:
and that sigh is in all sighs of love for ever
and ever.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a>
&ldquo;O beauty of my love the Sun-lord&rdquo; (<i>lit.</i> &ldquo;O
Youth, son of the Sun, how fair he is!&rdquo;)</p>
</div>

<p>Scathach watched him till he was lost
behind the flare of the camp-fires of the rath.
For long she stood there, brooding deep;
till the sickle of the new moon, which had
been like a blown feather over the sun as it
sank, stood out in silvershine against the
blue-black sky, now like a wake in the sea
because of the star-dazzle that was there.
And what the queen brooded upon was this:
whether to send emissaries to Eir&egrave;ann, under
bond to seek in that land till they found
M&iacute;dir and Et&aacute;in, and to slay M&iacute;dir and
bring to her the corpse, for a gift from her
to lay before Cuchullin: or to bring Et&aacute;in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>313]</a></span>
to Skye, where the Queen might see her lose
her beauty and wane into death. Neither
way might win the heart of Cuchullin. The
dark tarn of the woman&rsquo;s mind grew blacker
with the shadow of that thought.</p>

<p>Slowly she moved d&ucirc;n-ward through the
night. &ldquo;As the moon sometimes is seen
rising out of the east,&rdquo; she muttered, &ldquo;and
sometimes, as now, is first seen in the west,
so is the heart of love. And if I go west, lo
the moon may rise along the sunway: and if
I go east, lo the moon may be a white light
over the setting sun. And who that knoweth
the heart of man or woman can tell when the
moon of love is to appear full-orbed in the
east or sickle-wise in the west?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was on the day following that tidings
came out of Eir&egrave;ann. An Ultonian brought
a sword to Cuchullin from Concobar the
Ard-righ.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sword has ill upon it, and will die,
unless you save it, Cuculain son of Lerg,&rdquo;
said the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what is that ill, Ultonian?&rdquo; asked
the youth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is thirst.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>314]</a></span>
Then Cuchullin understood.</p>

<p>On the night of his going none looked at
Scathach. She had a flame in her eyes.</p>

<p>At moonrise, she came back into the rath.
No one, meeting her, looked in her face.
Death lay there, like the levin behind a
cloud. But Maev her chief captain sought
her, for she had glad news.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would slay you for that glad news,
Maev,&rdquo; said the Dark Queen to the warrior-woman,
&ldquo;for there is no glad news unless it
be that Cuchullin is come again: only, I
spare, for you saved my life that day the
summer-sailors burned my rath in the south.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Scathach had gladness because
of the tidings. Three viking-galleys
had been driven into Loch Scavaig, and
been dashed to death there by the whirling
wind and the narrow furious seas. Of the
ninety men who had sailed in them, only a
score had reached the rocks: and these were
now lying bound at the d&ucirc;n, awaiting death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Call out my warriors,&rdquo; said Scathach,
&ldquo;and bid all meet at the oak near the
Ancient Stones. And bring thither the
twenty men that lie bound in the d&ucirc;n.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>315]</a></span>
There was a scattering of fire and a clashing
of swords and spears, when the word
went from Maev. Soon all were at the
Stones beneath the great oak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cut the bonds from the feet of the sea-rovers,
and let them stand.&rdquo; Thus commanded
the Queen.</p>

<p>The tall fair men out of Lochlin stood,
with their hands bound behind them. In
their eyes burned wrath and shame, because
that they were the sport of women. A
bitter death theirs, with no sword-song for
music. &ldquo;Take each by his long yellow
hair,&rdquo; said Scathach, &ldquo;and tie the hair
of each to a down-caught bough of the
oak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In silence this thing was done. A shadow
was in the paleness of each viking-face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let the boughs go,&rdquo; said Scathach.</p>

<p>The five score warrior-women who held
the great boughs downward, sprang back.
Up swept the branches, and from each swung
a living man, swaying in the wind by his long
yellow hair.</p>

<p>Great men they were, strong warriors: but
stronger was the yellow hair of each, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>316]</a></span>
stronger than the hair the bough wherefrom
each swung and stronger than the boughs
the wind that swayed them idly like drooping
fruit, with the stars silvering their hair
and the torch-flares reddening the white
soles of their dancing feet.</p>

<p>Then Scathach the Queen laughed loud
and long. There was no other sound at all
there, for none ever uttered sound when
Scathach laughed that laugh, for then her
madness was upon her.</p>

<p>But at the last Maev strode forward, and
struck a small <span lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">clarsach</span> that she carried, and
to the wild notes of it sang the death-song
of the vikings.</p>

<span class="i5">O, O, arone, a-ree, eily arone!<br /></span>

<p>When she ceased, all there swung swords
and spears, and flung flaring torches into the
night, and cried out:</p>

<span class="i0"><i>O, O, arone, a-ree, eily arone!</i><br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Scathach laughed no more. She was weary
now. Of what avail any joy of death against
the pain she had in her heart, the pain that
was called Cuchullin?</p>

<p>Soon all was dark in the rath. Flame
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>318]</a></span>
after flame died out. Then there was but
one red glare in the night, the watch-fire by
the d&ucirc;n. Deep peace was upon all. Not a
heifer lowed, not a dog bayed against the moon.
The wind fell into a breath, scarce enough
to lift the fragrance from flower to flower.
Upon the branches of a great oak swung
motionless a strange fruit, limp and gray as
the hemlock that hangs from ancient pines.</p>

The first part of the story of Ula and Urla, as
Isla and Eilidh, is told in &ldquo;Silk o&rsquo; the Kine,&rdquo; at
the end of <i>The Sin-Eater</i>. [The name, Eilidh, is
pronounced Eily (<i>liq.</i>) or Isle-ih.]</p>
</div>

<div class="cpoem30">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Rose of all Roses, Rose of all the World!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You, too, have come where the dim tides are hurled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the wharves of sorrow, and heard ring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bell that calls us on: the sweet far thing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beauty grown sad with its eternity<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made you of us, and of the dim gray sea.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">U</span>LA and Urla were under vow to meet
by the Stone of Sorrow. But Ula,
dying first, stumbled blindfold when he
passed the Shadowy Gate: and, till Urla&rsquo;s
hour was upon her, she remembered not.</p>



<p class="break">These were the names that had been
given to them in the north isles, when the
birlinn that ran down the war-galley of the
vikings brought them before the Maormor.</p>

<p>No word had they spoken that day, and no
name. They were of the Gael, though Ula&rsquo;s
hair was yellow and though his eyes were
blue as the heart of a wave. They would
ask nothing, for both were in love with
death. The Maormor of Siol Tormaid looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>322]</a></span>
at Urla, and his desire gnawed at his heart.
But he knew what was in her mind, because
he saw into it through her eyes, and he
feared the sudden slaying in the dark.</p>

<p>Nevertheless he brooded night and day
upon her beauty. Her skin was more white
than the foam of the moon: her eyes were
as a starlit dewy dusk. When she moved,
he saw her like a doe in the fern: when she
stooped, it was as the fall of wind-swayed
water. In his eyes there was a shimmer as
of the sunflood in a calm sea. In that
dazzle he was led astray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; he said to Ula, on a day of the
days. &ldquo;Go: the men of Siol Torquil will
take you to the South Isles, and so you can
hale to your own place, be it Eir&egrave;ann or
Manannan, or wherever the south wind puts
its hand upon your home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was on that day Ula spoke for the first
time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will go, Coll mac Torcall: but I go
not alone. Urla that I love goes whither I
go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is my spoil. But, man out of
Eir&egrave;ann&mdash;for so I know you to be, because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>323]</a></span>
of the manner of your speech&mdash;tell me this:
of what clan and what place are you, and
whence is Urla come: and by what shore
was it that the men of Lochlin whom we
slew took you and her out of the sea, as you
swam against the sun, with waving swords
upon the strand when the viking-boat carried
you away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How know you these things?&rdquo; asked
Ula, that had been Isla, son of the king of
Islay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of the sea-rovers spake before he
died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then let the viking speak again. I have
nought to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With that the Maormor frowned, but said
no more. That eve Ula was seized, as he
walked in the dusk by the sea, singing low
to himself an ancient song.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it death?&rdquo; he said, remembering
another day when he and Eilidh, that they
called Urla, had the same asking upon their
lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ula frowned, but spake no word for a
time. Then he spake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>324]</a></span>
&ldquo;Let me say one word with Urla.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No word canst thou have. She too
must die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ula laughed low at that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am ready,&rdquo; he said. And they slew
him with a spear.</p>

<p>When they told Urla she rose from the
deer-skins and went down to the shore. She
said no word, then. But she stooped, and
she put her lips upon his cold lips: and she
whispered in his unhearing ear.</p>

<p>That night Coll mac Torcall went secretly
to where Urla was. When he entered, a
groan came to his lips, and there was froth
there: and that was because the spear that
had slain Ula was thrust betwixt his shoulders
by one who stood in the shadow. He lay
there till the dawn. When they found Coll
the Maormor he was like a seal speared upon
a rock, for he had his hands out, and his
head was between them, and his face was
downward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eat dust, slain wolf,&rdquo; was all that Eilidh
whom they called Urla said ere she moved
away from that place in the darkness of the
night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>325]</a></span>
When the sun rose, Urla was in a glen
among the hills. A man who shepherded
there took her to his mate. They gave her
milk, and because of her beauty, and the
frozen silence of her eyes, bade her stay with
them, and be at peace.</p>

<p>They knew, in time, that she wished death.
But, first, there was the birthing of the child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was Isla&rsquo;s will,&rdquo; she said to the woman.
Ula was but the shadow of a bird&rsquo;s wing:
an idle name. And she, too, was Eilidh once
more. &ldquo;It was death he gave you when he
gave you the child,&rdquo; said the woman once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was life,&rdquo; answered Eilidh, with her
eyes filled with the shadow of dream. And
yet another day the woman said to her that
it would be well to bear the child and let it
die: for beauty was like sunlight on a day
of clouds, and if she were to go forth young
and alone and so wondrous fair, she would
have love, and love is best.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Truly, love is best,&rdquo; Eilidh answered.
&ldquo;And because Isla loved me, I would that
another Isla came into the world, and sang
his songs&mdash;the songs that were so sweet,
and the songs that he never sang, because I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>326]</a></span>
gave him death when I gave him life. But
now he shall live again&mdash;and he and I shall
be in one body, in him that I carry now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that the woman understood, and said
no more. And so the days grew out of the
nights, and the dust of the feet of one month
was in the eyes of that which followed after:
and this until Eilidh&rsquo;s time was come.</p>



<p class="break">Dusk after dusk, Ula that was Isla the
Singer, waited by the Stone of Sorrow.
Then a great weariness came upon him.
He made a song there, where he lay in the
narrow place: the last song that he made,
for after that he heard no trampling of the
hours.</p>

<div class="cpoem30">

</div>
</div>

<p>But, at the last, after many days, he stirred.
There was a song in his ears.</p>

<p>He listened. It was like soft rain in a
wood in June. It was like the wind laughing
among the leaves.</p>

<p>Then his heart leapt. Sure, it was the
voice of Eilidh!</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Eilidh! Eilidh! Eilidh!</em>&rdquo; he cried.
But a great weariness came upon him again.
He fell asleep, knowing not the little hand
that was in his and the small flower-sweet
body that was warm against his side.</p>

<p>Then the child that was his looked into
the singer&rsquo;s heart, and saw there a mist of
rainbows, and midway in that mist was the
face of Eilidh his mother.</p>

<p>Thereafter the little one looked into his
brain that was so still, and he saw the music
that was there: and it was the voice of
Eilidh his mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>328]</a></span>
And, again, the birdeen, that had the blue
of Isla&rsquo;s eyes and the dream of Eilidh&rsquo;s,
looked into Ula&rsquo;s sleeping soul: and he saw
that it was not Isla nor yet Eilidh, but that
it was like unto himself, who was made of
Eilidh and Isla.</p>

<p>For a long time the child dreamed. Then
he put his ear to Isla&rsquo;s brow, and listened.
Ah, the sweet songs that he heard. Ah,
bitter-sweet moonseed of song! Into his
life they passed, echo after echo, strain after
strain, wild air after wild sweet air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isla shall never die,&rdquo; whispered the child,
&ldquo;for Eilidh loved him. And I am Isla and
Eilidh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the little one put his hands above
Isla&rsquo;s heart. There was a flame there, that
the Grave quenched not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O flame of love!&rdquo; sighed the child, and
he clasped it to his breast: and it was a
moonshine glory about the two hearts that
he had, the heart of Isla and the heart of
Eilidh, that were thenceforth one.</p>

<p>At dawn he was no longer there. Already
the sunrise was warm upon him where he
lay, newborn, upon the breast of Eilidh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>329]</a></span>
&ldquo;It is the end,&rdquo; murmured Isla when he
waked. &ldquo;She has never come. For sure
now, the darkness and the silence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he remembered the words of Maol
the Druid, he that was a seer and had told
him of Orchil, the dim goddess who is under
the brown earth, in a vast cavern, where she
weaves at two looms. With one hand she
weaves life upward through the grass: with
the other she weaves death downward through
the mould: and the sound of the weaving is
Eternity, and the name of it in the green
world is Time. And, through all, Orchil
weaves the weft of Eternal Beauty, that
passeth not, though its soul is Change.</p>

<p>And these were the words of Orchil, on
the lips of Maol the Druid, that was old, and
knew the mystery of the Grave:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>When thou journeyest towards the Shadowy
Gate take neither Fear with thee nor
Hope, for both are abashed hounds of silence
in that place: but take only the purple nightshade
for sleep, and a vial of tears and wine,
tears that shall be known unto thee and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>330]</a></span>
old wine of love. So shalt thou have thy
silent festival, ere the end.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So therewith Isla, having in his weariness
the nightshade of sleep, and in his mind the
slow dripping rain of familiar tears, and
deep in his heart the old wine of love, bowed
his head.</p>

<p>It was well to have lived, since life was
Eilidh. It was well to cease to live, since
Eilidh came no more.</p>

<p>Then suddenly he raised his head. There
was music in the green world above. A sun-ray
opened the earth about him: staring
upward he beheld Angus Ogue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, fair face of the god of youth,&rdquo; he
sighed. Then he saw the white birds that
fly about the head of Angus Ogue, and he
heard the music that his breath made upon
the harp of the wind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arise,&rdquo; said Angus; and, when he smiled,
the white birds flashed their wings and made
a mist of rainbows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arise,&rdquo; said Angus Ogue again; and,
when he spoke, the spires of the grass
quivered to a wild sweet haunting air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>331]</a></span>
So Isla arose, and the sun shone upon him,
and his shadow passed into the earth. Orchil
wove it into her web of death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why dost thou wait here by the Stone of
Sorrow, Isla that was called Ula at the end?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wait for Eilidh, who cometh not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At that the wind-listening god stooped
and laid his head upon the grass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hear the coming of a woman&rsquo;s feet,&rdquo;
he said, and he rose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eilidh! Eilidh!&rdquo; cried Isla, and the
sorrow of his cry was a moan in the web of
Orchil.</p>

<p>Angus Ogue took a branch, and put the
cool greenness against his cheek.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hear the beating of a heart,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eilidh! Eilidh! Eilidh!&rdquo; Isla cried, and
the tears that were in his voice were turned
by Angus into dim dews of remembrance in
the babe-brain that was the brain of Isla and
Eilidh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hear a word,&rdquo; said Angus Ogue, &ldquo;and
that word is a flame of joy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Isla listened. He heard a singing of birds.
Then, suddenly, a glory came into the shine
of the sun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>332]</a></span>
&ldquo;<em>I have come, Isla my king!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the voice of Eilidh. He bowed
his head, and swayed; for it was his own life
that came to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Eilidh!</em>&rdquo; he whispered.</p>

<p>And so, at the last, Isla came into his
kingdom.</p>



<p class="break">But are they gone, these twain, who loved
with deathless love? Or is this a dream
that I have dreamed?</p>

<p>Afar in an island-sanctuary that I shall not
see again, where the wind chants the blind
oblivious rune of Time, I have heard the
grasses whisper: <em>Time never was, Time is
not.</em></p>
